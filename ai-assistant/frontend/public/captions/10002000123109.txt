 The image is a table that summarizes the different types of cardiomyopathy. 

There are three main types of cardiomyopathy: dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive. 

- Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by systolic dysfunction, which means that the heart is unable to contract properly. This can lead to signs of heart failure, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. 


- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by hypertrophy, or thickening, of the heart muscle. This can make it difficult for the heart to fill with blood, which can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness. 


- Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterized by impaired ventricular filling, which can be caused by a variety of factors, such as scarring or inflammation of the heart muscle. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs. 

The treatment for cardiomyopathy depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and the severity of the symptoms. Treatment may include medications, surgery, or a heart transplant.
