**Osteoporosis**

- Osteoporosis is a perfect example of a multifunctional disease.
- A complex interplay of the following factors contributes to a person's risk of developing the disease:
 - Genetic factors
 - Intrinsic factors
 - Exogenous factors
 - Lifestyle factors


- In a normal bone, constant growth of bone mass and thus bone remodeling takes place.


- Three main mechanisms that can lead to osteoporosis are the following:
 - Inadequate peak bone mass (The skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth)
 - Increased bone resorption which can lead to bone loss
 - Inadequate new bone formation during bone remodeling.


- These processes take place in the bone multicellular units (BMUs). They are:
 - Osteoclasts
 - Osteoblasts


- Loss of bone mass occurs through the activation of the osteoclastogenic pathway.


**Osteoclastogenic Pathway**

- Two main cells are involved in this particular pathway which plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. They are osteoclasts and osteoblasts.
 - Osteoblasts: Responsible for bone resorption.
 - Osteoclasts: Determine the final outcome of bone resorption.


- The balance of these two activities is essential and it is influenced by macrophages and innate adaptive immunity.


- This ultimately helps in the formation of a normal bone.


- Bone mass loss which can lead to osteoporosis happens when the balance between the osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity is disrupted.


**Role of hormones**

- Estrogen and calcium in addition to that also plays a major role in bone turnover.
- Bone mass formation or bone deposition will be impaired due to vitamin D deficiency and calcium deficiency.
- This leads to secretion of parathyroid hormones (Parathormone and PTH) by the parathyroid gland.
- This is to ensure adequate calcium level in the blood and thereby increasing bone resorption.


**Genetics**

- Certain genes are involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis.
- Mutation caused in these genes can lead to certain rare diseases:
 - Osteoblast regulatory gene
 - Osteoclast regulatory gene
 - Bone matrix elements gene
 - Hormone/receptor genes
