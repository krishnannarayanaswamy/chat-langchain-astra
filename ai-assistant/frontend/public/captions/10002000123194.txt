 ## UROLITHIASIS
**Definition**
- Urolithiasis is a disease in which stones form in the organs of the urinary system, in most cases in the kidneys and the bladder. 
- It is also known as: 
 - Renal calculi
 - Nephrolithiasis
- Urine contains many dissolved minerals and salts, the level of which increases, stones are formed.
- The stones will be small in size initially. But they tend to grow larger eventually.
- Some of the stones thus formed might stay in the kidney without causing much trouble.
- If the stones reach the bladder after traveling through the ureter, it can be passed by the body.
- If the stone becomes lodged in the ureter, it blocks the urine flow from that kidney and causes pain.
- Young population most often have stones in the ureters and kidneys; whereas bladder stones are commonly diagnosed among the elderly and in children.
- Renal stones are formed in the kidneys and are called nephrolithiasis.
- Urolithiasis is a condition that occurs when these stones exit the renal pelvis of one's body and move to the remainder of the urinary collecting system, which includes: 
 - Ureters
 - Bladder
 - Urethra

**Etiology**
- Low urine volume
 - Constant low urine volume is a major risk factor for kidney stones.
 - Low urine volume can be a result of: 
   - Dehydration from hard exercise
   - Working or living in a hot place
   - Not drinking enough fluids
- In such a case, the urine will be more concentrated and will be dark colored.
- Hence, there will be less fluid in the urine to dissolve the salts.
- Adults who have stones should drink enough fluid to make at least 2.5 liters of urine per day.

**Diet**
- High levels of calcium in the diet can lead to the formation of calcium stones in the urine.
- Increased level of calcium in the urine is not always because of the amount of calcium intake through the daily diet; but it is also because of the way your body handles calcium.
 - Hence, controlling the calcium intake won't always help to cease the formation of calcium stones in the urine.
- Instead decreasing one's salt intake (too much of salt in the diet is a risk factor for calcium stones) helps to reduce the chance of formation of calcium stones.
- Oxalate is a component of the most common type of kidney stone, which is calcium oxalate. Hence, eating food which is rich in oxalate can the risk of forming these stones.
 - Also, increase in acid levels in the body and in the urine can increase the risk of formation of calcium oxalate and uric acid stones.
- Acid levels in the urine and body is increased due to the increased consumption of food items which are rich in animal protein, such as: 
 - Beef
 - Fish
 - Chicken
 - Pork
- Meat when broken down forms uric acid which increases the chance that both calcium and uric acid will form.

**Bowel Conditions**
- Certain bowel conditions can result in loss of large amount of fluid from the body which ultimately lowers one's urine volume.
- Diarrhoea can be caused due to conditions such as: 
 - Crohn's disease
 - Ulcerative colitis
 - Surgeries such as gastric bypass surgery
