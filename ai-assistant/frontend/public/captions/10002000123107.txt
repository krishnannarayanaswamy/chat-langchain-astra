 ## **Arterial Blood Flow**
When the heart beats, it pumps oxygenated blood to the body through a complex network of arteries. The arteries branch out from the heart, becoming smaller and smaller as they reach the farthest corners of the body. The smallest arteries are called arterioles. They branch out into tiny capillaries, which are so small that they can only carry one red blood cell at a time. The capillaries allow oxygen and nutrients to pass through their walls to the surrounding tissues. Deoxygenated blood, carrying waste products, flows back to the heart through a system of veins.

### **Peripheral Arterial Disease**
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a narrowing of the arteries in the legs, arms, or head. It is caused by atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of plaque on the inner walls of the arteries. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances. As plaque builds up, it can narrow the arteries and make it difficult for blood to flow through them. This can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the affected limbs. In severe cases, PAD can lead to amputation.

### **Symptoms of PAD**
The symptoms of PAD can vary depending on the severity of the disease. In some people, PAD may not cause any symptoms at all. In others, it can cause pain, numbness, or weakness in the affected limbs. The pain is often described as a cramping or aching pain that occurs when you walk or exercise. It usually goes away when you rest. Numbness and weakness can also occur in the affected limbs. In severe cases, PAD can cause the skin to break down and form ulcers.

### **Risk Factors for PAD**
The risk factors for PAD include:

* Age: PAD is more common in people over the age of 50.
* Smoking: Smoking is the single biggest risk factor for PAD.
* Diabetes: People with diabetes are at an increased risk for PAD.
* High blood pressure: High blood pressure can damage the arteries and make them more likely to develop plaque.
* High cholesterol: High cholesterol can contribute to the formation of plaque in the arteries.
* Obesity: Obesity is a risk factor for PAD.
* Family history of PAD: People with a family history of PAD are at an increased risk for the disease.

### **Diagnosis of PAD**
PAD is diagnosed based on a physical examination, your medical history, and the results of various tests. Your doctor may order one or more of the following tests:

* Ankle-brachial index (ABI): The ABI is a test that compares the blood pressure in your ankle to the blood pressure in your arm. A low ABI may be a sign of PAD.
* Doppler ultrasound: A Doppler ultrasound is a test that uses sound waves to measure the blood flow in your arteries.
* Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA): An MRA is a test that uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to create images of your arteries.
* Computed tomography angiography (CTA): A CTA is a test that uses computed tomography (CT) to create images of your arteries.

### **Treatment for PAD**
The treatment for PAD depends on the severity of the disease. In some cases, lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet, and exercising, may be enough to improve symptoms. In other cases, medications may be necessary to lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. In severe cases, surgery or angioplasty may be necessary to clear the blocked arteries.

### **Prevention of PAD**
There are a number of things you can do to help prevent PAD, including:

* Quitting smoking
* Eating a healthy diet
* Exercising regularly
* Maintaining a healthy weight
* Controlling your blood pressure
* Controlling your cholesterol
* Managing your diabetes

If you have any of the risk factors for PAD, talk to your doctor about ways to reduce your risk.
