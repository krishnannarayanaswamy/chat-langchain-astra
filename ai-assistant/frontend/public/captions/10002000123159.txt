 **Image Description**

The image shows two diagrams of the metabolism of dietary fats and cholesterol.

**Diagram 44.1** shows the **metabolism of dietary fats**. After ingestion, dietary fats are absorbed into the small intestine and packaged into chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are then transported to the bloodstream, where they are broken down by lipoprotein lipase into free fatty acids and glycerol. The free fatty acids are then taken up by cells for use as energy or storage. The glycerol is released into the bloodstream, where it is taken up by the liver and converted into glucose.

**Diagram 44.2** shows the **metabolism of cholesterol**. Cholesterol is absorbed into the small intestine and transported to the liver. The liver then packages cholesterol into VLDL particles, which are transported to the bloodstream. VLDL particles are then broken down by lipoprotein lipase into LDL particles, which are taken up by cells for use in cell membranes and hormone production. The liver also produces HDL particles, which help to remove cholesterol from the bloodstream.

**Summary of Tables and Flowcharts**

- Table 44.1 summarizes the composition of chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL, and HDL particles.
- Table 44.2 summarizes the steps involved in the metabolism of dietary fats and cholesterol.
- Figure 44.3 shows the flow of cholesterol through the body.

**Explanation**

Dietary fats are an important source of energy for the body. They are also used to make cell membranes and hormones. Cholesterol is a type of fat that is essential for the proper functioning of the body. It is used to make cell membranes, hormones, and bile acids.

The metabolism of dietary fats and cholesterol is a complex process that involves several steps. After ingestion, dietary fats are absorbed into the small intestine and packaged into chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are then transported to the bloodstream, where they are broken down by lipoprotein lipase into free fatty acids and glycerol. The free fatty acids are then taken up by cells for use as energy or storage. The glycerol is released into the bloodstream, where it is taken up by the liver and converted into glucose.

Cholesterol is absorbed into the small intestine and transported to the liver. The liver then packages cholesterol into VLDL particles, which are transported to the bloodstream. VLDL particles are then broken down by lipoprotein lipase into LDL particles, which are taken up by cells for use in cell membranes and hormone production. The liver also produces HDL particles, which help to remove cholesterol from the bloodstream.

The metabolism of dietary fats and cholesterol is essential for the proper functioning of the body. However, if the levels of these substances in the blood become too high, they can lead to health problems such as heart disease and stroke.
