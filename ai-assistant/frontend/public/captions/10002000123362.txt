 The image is about sinusitis. It starts with the definition of sinusitis which is inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. It can be acute, subacute or chronic. The most common sinus affected in adults is the maxillary sinus while in children it is the ethmoidal sinus. The least common sinus affected is the sphenoid sinus.

The etiology of acute sinusitis is usually a viral infection that is followed by a bacterial invasion. Exciting factors include nasal infection, swimming and diving, trauma and dental infection. Predisposing factors include obstruction to sinus ventilation and drainage, stasis of secretion in nasal cavity and ciliary motility defect.

The clinical features of acute sinusitis include nasal obstruction, purulent nasal discharge, facial pain or pressure, headache, cough, halitosis, ear pain and pressure, dental pain, fever, nasal congestion, hyposmia or anosmia and facial congestion or fullness.

There is a postural test done to differentiate maxillary sinusitis from frontal and ethmoidal sinusitis. The test involves cleaning the pus in the middle meatus and then putting the patient in a head lying position on the opposite side. If there is a reappearance of pus, then it is identified as maxillary sinusitis. If there is no reappearance of pus, the patient is asked to sit upright with the head hanging down. If there is a reappearance of pus, it is identified as frontal sinusitis. If there is no reappearance of pus in both positions, it is called ethmoidal sinusitis.
