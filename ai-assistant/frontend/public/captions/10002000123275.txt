 The image is a table that lists the diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). 

**NF1**

NF1 is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to form on nerve tissue. It is caused by a pathogenic variant in the NF1 gene, which encodes a protein called neurofibromin. Neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor protein that helps regulate cell growth and division. When neurofibromin is not working properly, cells can grow and divide uncontrollably, leading to the formation of tumors.

The diagnostic criteria for NF1 are:

* Six or more caf√©-au-lait spots
* Two or more neurofibromas
* Freckling in the armpit or groin area
* Optic glioma
* Two or more Lisch nodules
* Bone dysplasia
* A first-degree relative with NF1

**NF2**

NF2 is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to form on the nerves and in the brain. It is caused by a pathogenic variant in the NF2 gene, which encodes a protein called merlin. Merlin is a tumor suppressor protein that helps regulate cell growth and division. When merlin is not working properly, cells can grow and divide uncontrollably, leading to the formation of tumors.

The diagnostic criteria for NF2 are:

* Bilateral vestibular schwannomas
* A first-degree relative with NF2
* Meningioma
* Glioma
* Schwannoma
* Juvenile superior subcapsular lenticular opacities
* Juvenile cortical cataract

**Treatment**

There is no cure for NF1 or NF2, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.

**Prognosis**

The prognosis for people with NF1 and NF2 varies depending on the severity of the disease. Most people with NF1 have a normal life expectancy, but some people with severe disease may have a shortened life expectancy. The prognosis for people with NF2 is generally worse than the prognosis for people with NF1.
