BELL'S PALSY
Introduction
The bell's palsy is an acute, unilateral, partial, or complete
facial weakness or paralysis. It can be idiopathic in onset or
attributed to an acute non-supportive facial nerve
inflammation due to the re-activation of the herpes virus
within the stylomastoid foramen (geniculate ganglion).
It may occur at any age, from infancy to old age but appears
to be most common in young adults; males are affected more
than females. It is also common in diabetic patients and
pregnant females.
Visceral efferent fibers (facial expression muscles, stapedius muscle)

The facial nerve, also known as the seventh cranial nerve
(cranial nerve VII or simply CN VII), is a cranial nerve that
arises from the Pons of the brainstem. The facial nerve has
branches along the intracranial, intratemporal, and
extratemporal planes.
Facial nerve controls parasympathetic and motor functions.
It also regulates the lacrimal and salivary glands. The facial
nerve controls upper and lower facial muscles, thus
regulating facial expression and conveying taste sensations
from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.
