 **Topic: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)**

**Definition:**
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland. The prostate gland is a small gland in men that produces seminal fluid, which helps to nourish and transport sperm. As men age, the prostate gland often enlarges, which can cause problems with urination.

**Symptoms of BPH:**
The symptoms of BPH can include:

Difficulty starting to urinate
Weak or slow urine stream
Frequent urination, especially at night
Feeling like you can't empty your bladder completely
Having to strain to urinate
Leaking urine

**Risk Factors for BPH:**
The risk factors for BPH include:

Age: BPH is most common in men over 50.
Family history: Men with a family history of BPH are more likely to develop the condition.
Race: African-American men are more likely to develop BPH than white men.
Medical conditions: Men with diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure are more likely to develop BPH.

**Diagnosis of BPH:**
BPH is diagnosed based on a man's symptoms and a physical exam. The doctor may also order tests, such as a urine flow study or a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, to help confirm the diagnosis.

**Treatment for BPH:**
The treatment for BPH depends on the severity of the symptoms. Treatment options include:

Medications: Medications can help to relax the muscles in the prostate gland and improve urine flow.
Surgery: Surgery may be necessary if medications don't work or if the symptoms are severe.
Minimally invasive therapies: These therapies are less invasive than surgery and can be used to treat BPH in men who are not good candidates for surgery.

**Prevention of BPH:**
There is no sure way to prevent BPH, but there are some things you can do to reduce your risk, such as:

Eating a healthy diet
Exercising regularly
Maintaining a healthy weight
Avoiding smoking
Managing your blood pressure and cholesterol

**Prognosis for BPH:**
The prognosis for BPH is generally good. Most men with BPH can be successfully treated with medications or surgery.
