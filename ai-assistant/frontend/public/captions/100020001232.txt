 **UNIT 4 - CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM**
**27. General Anatomy and Physiology- Cardiovascular System**
The cardiovascular system is a network of blood vessels that transport blood throughout the body. It is made up of the heart, blood vessels, and blood.
The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood through the blood vessels. The blood vessels are arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries carry blood away from the heart, veins carry blood back to the heart, and capillaries are small blood vessels that allow oxygen and nutrients to pass from the blood to the cells of the body.
Blood is a fluid that carries oxygen, nutrients, and waste products throughout the body. It is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma.
**28. Myocardial Infarction**
A myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to a part of the heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common cause of a heart attack is a blood clot that blocks one of the coronary arteries, which are the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle.
Symptoms of a heart attack can include chest pain, shortness of breath, pain in the arms, neck, or jaw, and sweating. If you think you are having a heart attack, call 911 immediately.
Treatment for a heart attack may include medications to dissolve the blood clot, surgery to bypass the blocked artery, or angioplasty, which is a procedure to open up the blocked artery.
**29. Congestive Heart Failure CHF**
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. CHF can be caused by a variety of factors, including heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes.
Symptoms of CHF can include shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the feet and ankles, and chest pain. Treatment for CHF may include medications to improve heart function, lifestyle changes, and surgery.
**30. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)**
Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a condition in which the arteries in the legs or arms become narrowed or blocked. PAD can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the legs or arms. It can also increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.
Symptoms of PAD can include pain in the legs or arms, numbness or weakness in the legs or arms, and sores on the legs or feet that do not heal. Treatment for PAD may include medications to improve blood flow, lifestyle changes, and surgery.
**31. Cardiomyopathy**
Cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thickened, or stiff. Cardiomyopathy can cause heart failure and other heart problems.
Symptoms of cardiomyopathy can include shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and swelling in the feet and ankles. Treatment for cardiomyopathy may include medications to improve heart function, lifestyle changes, and surgery.
**32. Deep venous thrombosis**
Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the leg. DVT can be dangerous because it can lead to a pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot that travels to the lungs.
Symptoms of DVT can include pain, swelling, and tenderness in the leg. Treatment for DVT may include medications to dissolve the blood clot, wearing compression stockings, and elevating the leg.

**UNIT 5-ENDOCRINE SYSTEM**
**33. Acromegaly**
Acromegaly is a condition in which the body produces too much growth hormone. This can cause the bones and organs to grow larger than normal.
Symptoms of acromegaly can include enlarged hands and feet, a protruding jaw, and a deep voice. Treatment for acromegaly may include medications to reduce growth hormone production, surgery, and radiation therapy.
**34. Addison disease**
Addison disease is a condition in which the body does not produce enough of the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including weight loss, fatigue, and low blood pressure.
Symptoms of Addison disease can include weight loss, fatigue, low blood pressure, and darkening of the skin. Treatment for Addison disease may include medications to replace cortisol and aldosterone.
**35. Cushing's syndrome**
Cushing's syndrome is a condition in which the body produces too much of the hormone cortisol. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including weight gain, high blood pressure, and diabetes.
Symptoms of Cushing's syndrome can include weight gain
