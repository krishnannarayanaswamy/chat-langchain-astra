 # **Addison Disease**
**Definition**
Adrenal gland is known to produce two important hormones:
- Cortisol
- Aldosterone

Addison's disease is a rare condition in which a person's adrenal gland fails to produce enough of these hormones.
The major cause for this particular condition is an autoimmune attack and is treatable with medication.

**Etiology**
Types of Adrenal Insufficiency
- **Central AI**
 - **Primary**
 - **Hypothalamic/CRH production affected**
 - **Secondary**
 - **Pituitary ACTH/ Adrenal production affected**
- **Primary**
 - **Adrenal gland cause**
 - **Addison's disease**
 - **Congenital**
- **Tertiary**
 - **Genetic**
 - **Traumatic brain injury**

**Primary Adrenal Insufficiency**
Acute destruction of the adrenal gland is the main reason for this condition. 
Thus, they fail to produce the hormones that are supposed to produce.
Primary adrenal insufficiency is an autoimmune disease. The other major causes of primary adrenal gland insufficiency are:
- Long-term administration of glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone)
- Certain areas in the body
- Cancers
- Tuberculosis

**Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency**
Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) fails to produce adrenal glucocorticoids when released or the patient takes the corticosteroids to alleviate the symptoms.
The other major causes of secondary adrenal insufficiency are:
- Medications
- Tumors
- Trauma
- Genetic

**Tertiary Adrenal Insufficiency**
This type of adrenal insufficiency affects the hypothalamus.
In turn, it hampers the secretion of CRH from the pituitary gland.
Major cause of tertiary adrenal insufficiency is long-term steroid therapy.
Another cause of tertiary adrenal insufficiency is:
- Primary adrenal insufficiency: Affects adrenal gland
- Secondary adrenal insufficiency: Affects pituitary gland

**People at higher risk of Addison's disease might have the following conditions:**
- Taking blood thinners/anticoagulants
- Been on high doses of steroids
- Gotten any part of the adrenal gland removed through surgery
- Have had chronic infections like tuberculosis
