 The image is a table that compares and contrasts two medical conditions: discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). DLE is a chronic skin condition that causes red, scaly patches on the face, neck, and scalp. SLE is a more serious autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, and other organs.

The table compares the two conditions in terms of their symptoms, causes, and treatment. DLE is typically treated with topical steroids or antimalarial medications. SLE is treated with a variety of medications, including corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and biologics.

The prognosis for DLE is generally good, but the condition can be difficult to manage. The prognosis for SLE is more variable, but most patients can achieve remission with treatment.
