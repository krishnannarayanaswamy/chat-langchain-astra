 The image is a flowchart that provides a treatment algorithm for asthma. It is divided into two main sections: intermittent asthma and persistent asthma.

**Intermittent Asthma**

Intermittent asthma is defined as asthma symptoms that occur less than twice a week. The preferred controller medication for intermittent asthma is a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). If symptoms are not controlled with a low-dose ICS, a low-dose ICS-formoterol combination can be added.

**Persistent Asthma**

Persistent asthma is defined as asthma symptoms that occur more than twice a week. The preferred controller medication for persistent asthma is a medium-dose ICS-LABA combination. If symptoms are not controlled with a medium-dose ICS-LABA combination, a high-dose ICS-LABA combination can be added.

In addition to controller medications, reliever medications can also be used to treat asthma symptoms. Reliever medications are short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) that work by relaxing the muscles in the airways and improving airflow.

The table below summarizes the different treatment options for asthma.

| Treatment | Medication |
|---|---|
| Intermittent Asthma | Low-dose ICS |
| | Low-dose ICS-formoterol |
| Persistent Asthma | Medium-dose ICS-LABA |
| | High-dose ICS-LABA |
| Reliever Medication | SABA |

The flowchart below provides a more detailed overview of the treatment algorithm for asthma.

In addition to the medications listed in the table above, there are also a number of other treatments that can be used for asthma. These include:

* Leukotriene modifiers
* Theophylline
* Anticholinergics
* Biologic therapies

These treatments can be used in combination with controller and reliever medications to achieve optimal asthma control.
