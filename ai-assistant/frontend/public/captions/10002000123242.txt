 # **Myasthenia Gravis**

## **Introduction**
- Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that causes weakness in the skeletal muscles.
- The hallmark of myasthenia gravis is muscle weakness that improves after rest and worsens after periods of activity.
- The peak incidence in males is between 40-70 years, while in females, it is 20-40.
- Associated with thymic hyperplasia or thymoma.

## **Pathophysiology**
- Development of auto-antibodies against postsynaptic neuromuscular junction acetylcholine receptors
- The antibodies block the function of the receptor leading to muscle weakness and fatigue due to impaired neuromuscular transmission.
- Type II Hypersensitivity

## **Clinical Manifestations**
- Ocular manifestations
 - There is ptosis and mild extraocular muscle weakness.
 - Pupillary response to light is preserved, but in myasthenia gravis, this is not always the case.
 → Some individuals with myasthenia gravis may experience pupillary abnormalities, such as sluggish or unequal responses to light.
 - Diplopia
- GI manifestations
 - Dysphagia, mainly oropharyngeal
 → Characterized by difficulty in initiating swallowing.
- Musculoskeletal manifestations
 - Dysarthria
 - Facial weakness is common
 - Poor head control in infants
 - Weakness involves limb-girdle muscles, distal muscle of hands, bulbar-innervated muscles
 - Nomyalgias
 - Rapid fatigability
 → This is a characteristic feature.
- Respiratory failure may occur if left untreated.
- Neurologic manifestation
 - No fasciculations of muscle
 - No sensory symptoms
- Amyasthenic crisis may occur
 - Characterized by acute life-threatening exacerbation of the symptoms that may lead to respiratory failure.
 - Usually precipitated by physiological stress, medications, surgery, or pregnancy.
