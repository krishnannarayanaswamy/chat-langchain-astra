 The image shows the brain and its parts. The brain is divided into two hemispheres, the left and right hemispheres. Each hemisphere is further divided into four lobes: the frontal lobe, the parietal lobe, the temporal lobe, and the occipital lobe. The frontal lobe is responsible for higher-level cognitive functions such as planning, decision-making, and judgment. The parietal lobe is responsible for processing sensory information from the skin, muscles, and joints. The temporal lobe is responsible for processing auditory information and memory. The occipital lobe is responsible for processing visual information.

The brain is also divided into three sections: the forebrain, the midbrain, and the hindbrain. The forebrain is the most anterior part of the brain and contains the cerebral hemispheres. The midbrain is a small section of the brain that connects the forebrain to the hindbrain. The hindbrain is the most posterior part of the brain and contains the cerebellum and the brainstem.

The cerebellum is responsible for coordinating movement and balance. The brainstem is responsible for controlling vital life functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure.

The brain is protected by three layers of meninges: the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. The dura mater is the outermost layer of the meninges and is a tough, fibrous membrane. The arachnoid mater is the middle layer of the meninges and is a delicate, web-like membrane. The pia mater is the innermost layer of the meninges and is a thin, vascular membrane.

The brain is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear, colorless fluid that helps to protect the brain from injury. CSF is produced by the choroid plexus, which is a network of blood vessels located in the ventricles of the brain. The ventricles are four cavities in the brain that are filled with CSF. The ventricles are the lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, the fourth ventricle, and the cerebral aqueduct.

The spinal cord is a long, thin bundle of nerves that extends from the brain down the spinal column. The spinal cord is responsible for carrying messages between the brain and the rest of the body. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae of the spinal column.
