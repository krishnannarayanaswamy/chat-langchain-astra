 Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to your limbs. It's often caused by a buildup of plaque in your arteries (atherosclerosis).

PAD can affect arteries anywhere in your body, but it most often affects the arteries in your legs. This can cause pain, numbness, or weakness in your legs. It can also increase your risk of heart attack and stroke.

PAD is a serious condition, but it can be treated. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, medications, and surgery.

**Symptoms of PAD**

The symptoms of PAD can vary depending on the severity of the disease. In some people, PAD may not cause any symptoms. In others, it can cause pain, numbness, or weakness in the legs. The pain is often described as a cramping or aching pain that occurs when you walk or exercise. It usually goes away when you rest.

Other symptoms of PAD include:

* Numbness or tingling in your legs
* Cold feet
* Skin sores that don't heal
* Hair loss on your legs
* Weak or absent pulses in your legs

**Risk factors for PAD**

The risk factors for PAD include:

* Age (PAD is more common in people over the age of 50)
* Smoking
* Diabetes
* High blood pressure
* High cholesterol
* Obesity
* Physical inactivity
* Family history of PAD

**Diagnosis of PAD**

PAD is diagnosed based on your symptoms, a physical exam, and various tests. Your doctor may order one or more of the following tests:

* Ankle-brachial index (ABI): This test compares the blood pressure in your ankle to the blood pressure in your arm. An ABI of less than 0.9 is considered to be abnormal.
* Pulse volume recording (PVR): This test measures the blood flow in your legs.
* Duplex ultrasound: This test uses sound waves to create images of your arteries.
* Angiography: This test uses X-rays and a special dye to create images of your arteries.

**Treatment for PAD**

The treatment for PAD depends on the severity of the disease. Treatment options include:

* Lifestyle changes: These include quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight.
* Medications: These include aspirin, clopidogrel, cilostazol, and pentoxifylline.
* Surgery: This may be necessary to bypass blocked arteries or to widen narrowed arteries.

**Prevention of PAD**

You can help prevent PAD by making healthy lifestyle choices, such as:

* Quitting smoking
* Eating a healthy diet
* Exercising regularly
* Maintaining a healthy weight
* Managing your blood pressure and cholesterol
* Getting regular checkups with your doctor
