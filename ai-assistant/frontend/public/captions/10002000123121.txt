 The image is about Cushing's syndrome. It is a disorder that occurs when the body produces too much of the hormone cortisol. The most common cause of Cushing's syndrome is a tumor of the pituitary gland, which is a small gland located at the base of the brain. This tumor secretes a hormone called ACTH, which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce too much cortisol.
The symptoms of Cushing's syndrome can include weight gain, high blood pressure, diabetes, and muscle weakness. The syndrome can also cause changes in the skin, such as thinning and easy bruising.
Cushing's syndrome is diagnosed with a variety of tests, including blood and urine tests, and imaging studies. Treatment for Cushing's syndrome depends on the cause of the disorder.
