 The image shows a diagram of the brain and the areas that are affected by OCD. The cingulate gyrus is responsible for adding emotional responses to thoughts, while the prefrontal cortex integrates sensory information and makes decisions. The caudate nucleus processes and filters information, while the basal ganglia control movements, thinking, and judgment.
The graph shows the cumulative percentage of people with OCD who have an onset of symptoms at different ages. The majority of people with OCD have an onset of symptoms in their teens or early twenties.
OCD is a mental illness that causes people to have unwanted thoughts, images, or urges. These thoughts can be very distressing and can interfere with a person's daily life. People with OCD may also have compulsions, which are repetitive behaviors that they feel they need to do in order to reduce their anxiety.
OCD is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is often treated with medication and therapy.
