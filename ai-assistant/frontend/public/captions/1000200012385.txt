## Lung cancer (LC)
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
There are two main types of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
## Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
- SCLC accounts for about 10-15% of all lung cancers.
- It is more common in men than in women.
- It is usually found in people who smoke cigarettes.
- SCLC is a very aggressive type of cancer that grows and spreads quickly.
- The prognosis for SCLC is poor, with most patients dying within one to two years of diagnosis.
## Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
- NSCLC accounts for about 85% of all lung cancers.
- It is more common in men than in women.
- It is usually found in people who smoke cigarettes.
- NSCLC is less aggressive than SCLC, but it is still a serious disease.
- The prognosis for NSCLC depends on the stage of the cancer at diagnosis.
## Types of NSCLC
There are three main types of NSCLC:
- Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)
- Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC)
- Large cell carcinoma (LCC)
- LUAD is the most common type of NSCLC, accounting for about 40% of all cases.
- LUSC is the second most common type of NSCLC, accounting for about 25% of all cases.
- LCC is the third most common type of NSCLC, accounting for about 10% of all cases.
