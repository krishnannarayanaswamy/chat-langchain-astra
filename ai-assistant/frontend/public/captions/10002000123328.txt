 The image is about cutaneous horn, Bowen's disease, and squamous cell carcinoma.
    
Cutaneous horn is a conical projection of hyperkeratotic skin. It is a benign lesion that is most commonly found on the lower leg of elderly females. 

Bowen's disease is an intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). It is a premalignant lesion that can progress to invasive SCC. Bowen's disease is most commonly found on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and arms.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a malignant tumor that arises from epidermal keratinocytes or its appendages. It is the second most common skin cancer, after basal cell carcinoma. SCC is most commonly found on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and arms.

The management of Bowen's disease and premalignant dermatoses includes biopsy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), 5-FU, imiquimod, and cryotherapy.

The prognosis for SCC is generally good if it is caught and treated early. However, SCC can be fatal if it is not treated.
