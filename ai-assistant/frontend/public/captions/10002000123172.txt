 Image 47.1 shows the structure of a nephron, the functional unit of the kidney. 
The nephron is responsible for filtering waste products from the blood and producing urine.

Image 47.2 shows the process of urine formation. Urine is formed when blood is filtered through the nephron. The filtrate is then processed in the loop of Henle and the collecting duct to produce urine.

The nephron is a long, thin tube that is lined with capillaries. The capillaries are tiny blood vessels that allow for the exchange of substances between the blood and the filtrate.

The nephron is divided into three parts: the proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, and the distal convoluted tubule.

The proximal convoluted tubule is the first part of the nephron. It is lined with cuboidal cells that have a brush border. The brush border is made up of microvilli, which are small projections that increase the surface area of the cells. This allows for the efficient absorption of substances from the filtrate.

The loop of Henle is the middle part of the nephron. It is a long, thin tube that descends into the medulla and then ascends back up to the cortex. The loop of Henle is lined with thin, squamous cells. The descending limb of the loop of Henle is responsible for concentrating the filtrate. The ascending limb of the loop of Henle is responsible for diluting the filtrate.

The distal convoluted tubule is the last part of the nephron. It is lined with cuboidal cells that have a smooth border. The distal convoluted tubule is responsible for further processing the filtrate and preparing it for excretion.

The collecting duct is a long, thin tube that collects urine from the nephrons. The collecting duct is lined with cuboidal cells that have a smooth border. The collecting duct is responsible for concentrating the urine and preparing it for excretion.
The nephron is a complex structure that plays a vital role in the production of urine. The nephron filters waste products from the blood and produces urine. The nephron is also responsible for regulating the bodyâ€™s fluid and electrolyte balance.
