 The image is a table that summarizes the clinical features of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is a serious condition that can lead to widespread bleeding and organ damage. It is caused by a variety of factors, including sepsis, trauma, and cancer.

The clinical features of DIC are divided into three categories:

- Thrombosis: DIC can cause blood clots to form in the blood vessels, which can lead to organ damage and death.
- Bleeding: DIC can also cause bleeding, which can be severe and life-threatening.
- Organ dysfunction: DIC can damage organs, such as the liver, kidneys, and lungs.

The treatment of DIC depends on the underlying cause. Treatment may include blood transfusions, clotting factor replacement, and medications to stop bleeding.

Here are some additional details about the clinical features of DIC:

- Thrombosis: The most common type of thrombosis in DIC is deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the leg. DVT can be painful and can lead to swelling and discoloration of the leg. If a blood clot breaks loose from a DVT, it can travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism is a serious condition that can be fatal.
- Bleeding: DIC can cause bleeding from any site in the body. The most common type of bleeding is bruising. However, DIC can also cause bleeding from the nose, gums, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary tract. Severe bleeding can be life-threatening.
- Organ dysfunction: DIC can damage organs by causing blood clots to form in the blood vessels that supply those organs. This can lead to organ failure and death. The most common organs that are damaged by DIC are the liver, kidneys, and lungs.

DIC is a serious condition that can be fatal. However, early diagnosis and treatment can improve the chances of survival.
