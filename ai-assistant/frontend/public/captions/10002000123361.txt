 The image is a table that compares acute suppurative otitis media (ASOM) and secretory otitis media (SOM). ASOM is usually caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and presents with symptoms such as pain, hearing loss, and fever. Signs of ASOM include mild retraction of the tympanic membrane, bulging tympanic membrane, perforation, pulsatile otorrhea, and lighthouse sign. Investigation for ASOM is not necessary. Treatment for ASOM includes medical therapy with antibiotics, nasal decongestants, analgesics, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Surgery may be required in some cases and includes myringotomy at the posteroinferior quadrant and curvilinear incision.
SOM is usually caused by a non-infective cause such as nasal or nasopharyngeal cause and presents with symptoms such as hearing loss, poor school performance, and inattention. Signs of SOM include the presence of air bubbles and air-fluid level in the middle ear. Investigation for SOM includes tuning fork test, audiometry, and tympanometry. Treatment for SOM initially involves watchful waiting and medical therapy for 3 months. If symptoms persist after 3 months, myringotomy with grommet and underlying cause is done. The site of myringotomy is the anteroinferior quadrant.
