 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition that damages your kidneys' ability to filter waste from your blood. It can lead to serious health problems, such as heart disease and stroke.

**Stages of CKD**

CKD is divided into five stages, based on how much damage there is to your kidneys.

* Stage 1: Mild CKD. Your kidneys are slightly damaged, but they are still able to filter waste from your blood well.
* Stage 2: Moderate CKD. Your kidneys are more damaged, but they are still able to filter waste from your blood well.
* Stage 3: Severe CKD. Your kidneys are severely damaged, and they are starting to have trouble filtering waste from your blood.
* Stage 4: End-stage CKD. Your kidneys are very badly damaged, and they are no longer able to filter waste from your blood. You will need to have dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive.
* Stage 5: Kidney failure. Your kidneys have completely failed, and you need to have dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive.

**Symptoms of CKD**

CKD often does not cause any symptoms in the early stages. As the disease progresses, you may experience symptoms such as:

**Summary of Flowchart**

The flowchart shows that CKD is divided into five stages. The stages are based on how much damage there is to the kidneys. The symptoms of CKD vary depending on the stage of the disease. The treatments for CKD also vary depending on the stage of the disease.
