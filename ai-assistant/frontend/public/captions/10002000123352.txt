 **Table 101.1**

**Supraglottis**

**Incidence**
Most common in epiglottis

**Site**
Most commonly at free edge and superior
Surface of anterior and middle 1/3rd
of vocal cord

**Appearance**
Suprahyoid-exophyte
Sub hyoid-ulcerative
Nodule or ulcer thickening of vocal
cord

**Vocal cord**
Vocal cord involvement is very late.
So Vocal cord involvement of voice is
late

**Metastases**
Very early due to rich lymphatic supply
Bilateral lymph nodes are involved in case of
epiglottis carcinoma as it is middle Upper and
middle deep cervical lymph nodes are
involved
early. But vocal cord fixation indicates
infiltration of thyroarytenoid muscle
and is a very bad prognostic sign
Never because of scant lymphatics in
vocal cords

**Nature**
Silent until late. Dysphagia, throat pain, pain
in ear, respiratory distress are late feature

**Prognosis**
Bad because symptoms are late as it is silent
most of the time
Anaplastic and highly malignant

**Glottis**
Most common
Subglottic
Least common
Most common in midline in
anterior half
Nodule
Submucosal Nodule
So Vocal cord involvement of voice is
late
Early
Bilateral
Lower deep cervical, pretracheal
and para paratracheal
Hoarseness of voice
Good because
Presents early with HOV.
Well differentiated and less malignant
No lymphatic metastases
Silent Respiratory distress are
late features

**Explanation:**

The table summarizes the differences between supraglottic, glottic, and subglottic laryngeal cancer.

**Supraglottic cancer** is the most common type of laryngeal cancer, and it occurs in the upper part of the larynx, which is located above the vocal cords. 

**Glottic cancer** occurs in the middle part of the larynx, which includes the vocal cords. 

**Subglottic cancer** is the least common type of laryngeal cancer, and it occurs in the lower part of the larynx, which is located below the vocal cords.

The table shows that the symptoms of supraglottic cancer, such as hoarseness of voice, are often not present until the cancer is in an advanced stage. This is because the cancer is located in a part of the larynx that is not easily visible. 

In contrast, the symptoms of glottic cancer, such as hoarseness of voice, are usually present early on, because the cancer is located in a part of the larynx that is easily visible. 

The table also shows that the prognosis for supraglottic cancer is worse than the prognosis for glottic cancer. This is because supraglottic cancer is often diagnosed at a later stage, when it is more difficult to treat.
