 ## **General Physiology - Nervous System**

+ **Cells of the Nervous System**
+ There are two cells of the nervous system. These are;
 - Neuron
 - Neuroglia
+ The functional unit of the nervous system is the nerve cell, or neuron
+ Neuroglia or glial are supportive cells in the nervous system that aid the function of neurons

**Neurons (Nerve Cells)**
Neurons have three fundamental physiological properties:
- Excitability
- Conductivity
- Secretion
+ A typical neuron is divided into three parts;
 - Soma or cell body (perikaryon)
 - Dendrites
 - Axon

**Structure of a neuron**
+ **Axonal Transport**
 - Many proteins made in soma must be transported to axon and axon terminal
 - Repair axolemma, for gated ion channel proteins, as enzymes or neurotransmitters
 - Fast anterograde axonal transport
 - Either direction up to 400 mm/day for organelles, enzymes, vesicles and small molecules
 - Fast retrograde for recycled materials and pathogens
 - Slow axonal transport or axoplasmic flow
 - Moves cytoskeletal and new axoplasm at 10 mm/day during repair and regeneration in damaged
