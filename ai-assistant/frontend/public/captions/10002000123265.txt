 The image is a table that provides information about the management of epilepsy. The table is divided into three sections: medical treatment, surgical treatment, and complications of epilepsy.

**Medical treatment**

The first-line treatment for epilepsy is medication. There are a variety of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) available, and the choice of drug will depend on the individual patient's needs. AEDs can be taken orally or intravenously.

**Surgical treatment**

If medication is not effective in controlling seizures, surgery may be an option. The goal of surgery is to remove the part of the brain that is causing the seizures.

**Complications of epilepsy**

Epilepsy can lead to a number of complications, including:

* Status epilepticus: This is a medical emergency that occurs when a person has a seizure that lasts for more than 5 minutes.
* Breakthrough seizures: These are seizures that occur despite taking AEDs.
* Cognitive impairment: Epilepsy can lead to problems with memory, attention, and learning.
* Behavioral problems: Epilepsy can cause behavioral problems, such as aggression and irritability.
* Social problems: Epilepsy can lead to social problems, such as isolation and discrimination.

**Prognosis**

The prognosis for epilepsy varies depending on the individual patient. Some people with epilepsy are able to live seizure-free lives, while others may experience seizures throughout their lives. However, with proper treatment, most people with epilepsy can live full and productive lives.
