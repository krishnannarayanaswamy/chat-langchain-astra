 The image is a diagram of the urinary system. It shows the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The kidneys are located on either side of the spine, just below the rib cage. They are about the size of a fist. The ureters are thin tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. The bladder is a muscular organ that stores urine. The urethra is a tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.
    The urinary system filters waste products from the blood and produces urine. Urine is made up of water, urea, and other waste products. Urea is a nitrogen-containing compound that is produced when the body breaks down proteins.
    The kidneys filter waste products from the blood through a process called glomerular filtration. Glomerular filtration occurs in the glomerulus, which is a small cluster of blood vessels in the kidney. The glomerulus is surrounded by a Bowman's capsule, which is a cup-shaped structure that collects the filtered fluid. The filtered fluid then flows into the proximal convoluted tubule, which is a long, winding tube that leads to the loop of Henle. The loop of Henle is a U-shaped structure that descends into the medulla of the kidney and then ascends back to the cortex. The filtered fluid then flows into the distal convoluted tubule, which is another long, winding tube that leads to the collecting duct. The collecting duct carries the filtered fluid to the renal pelvis, which is a funnel-shaped structure that collects urine from the kidney. The urine then flows into the ureter and is carried to the bladder.
    The bladder stores urine until it is released through the urethra. The urethra is a tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.
    The urinary system is important for maintaining the body's fluid and electrolyte balance. It also helps to remove waste products from the body.
