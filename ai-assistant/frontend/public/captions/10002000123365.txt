Sinusitis is a condition in which the sinuses become inflamed. The sinuses are small, air-filled cavities in the skull that are located around the nose. When the sinuses become inflamed, they can produce a variety of symptoms, including headache, pain, tenderness, redness, swelling, and nasal discharge.
The symptoms of sinusitis can vary depending on the location of the sinuses that are inflamed. For example, frontal sinusitis causes pain and tenderness in the forehead, while maxillary sinusitis causes pain and tenderness in the cheek.
Sinusitis can be treated with a variety of medications, including antibiotics, decongestants, and pain relievers. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat sinusitis.
