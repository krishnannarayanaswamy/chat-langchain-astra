 The image is a table that shows the different types of hemoglobin, their levels, and their indications. Hemoglobin is a protein that is found in red blood cells and that carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. There are different types of hemoglobin, including hemoglobin A, hemoglobin A2, hemoglobin F, and hemoglobin S. Hemoglobin A is the most common type of hemoglobin, and it makes up about 97% of the total hemoglobin in adults. Hemoglobin A2 makes up about 2-3% of the total hemoglobin in adults, and it is similar to hemoglobin A but has a slightly different structure. Hemoglobin F is the main type of hemoglobin in fetuses and newborns, and it makes up about 50-90% of the total hemoglobin in these individuals. Hemoglobin S is a type of hemoglobin that is found in people with sickle cell disease, and it makes up about 5-10% of the total hemoglobin in these individuals.

The table also shows the levels of each type of hemoglobin. The normal level of hemoglobin in adults is 12-16 g/dL. The normal level of hemoglobin A2 is 1.5-3.5% of the total hemoglobin. The normal level of hemoglobin F is 50-90% of the total hemoglobin in neonates and 0-1% of the total hemoglobin in adults. The normal level of hemoglobin S is 5-10% of the total hemoglobin in people with sickle cell disease.

The table also shows the indications for each type of hemoglobin. Low levels of hemoglobin can indicate anemia or blood loss. High levels of hemoglobin may indicate polycythemia vera, a condition in which the body produces too many red blood cells. Abnormal levels of hemoglobin A2 can indicate thalassemia, a condition in which the body does not produce enough hemoglobin. Abnormal levels of hemoglobin F can indicate a variety of conditions, including sickle cell disease and thalassemia. Abnormal levels of hemoglobin S can indicate sickle cell disease.
