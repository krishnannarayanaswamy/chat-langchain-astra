 The image is a flowchart that provides an overview of the pathogenesis and clinical findings of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 

The first step in the development of NHL is the occurrence of genetic damage, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including environmental factors (e.g., radiation, chemicals), viruses (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus, human T-cell leukemia virus-1), and bacteria (e.g., Helicobacter pylori). This genetic damage can lead to the development of a monoclonal proliferation of lymphoid cells, which are the hallmark of NHL. 

These malignant cells can accumulate in lymphoid tissue, such as the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. They can also spread to other organs and tissues, such as the liver, lungs, and skin.

The clinical findings of NHL vary depending on the type of lymphoma, the stage of the disease, and the individual patient. Some of the most common symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and swollen lymph nodes. Other symptoms may include pain, shortness of breath, cough, and bleeding.

NHL is a serious disease, but it is important to remember that there are many effective treatment options available. The type of treatment that is recommended will depend on the type of lymphoma, the stage of the disease, and the individual patient.
