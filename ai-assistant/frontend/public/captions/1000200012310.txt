2 GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY-HEMATOLOGY

**Primary Hemostasis**
- The first step in clotting of blood is primary hemostasis, which results in the formation of a platelet plug. 
- The very first response after an endothelial injury is Vasoconstriction.

**Steps of primary Hemostasis**

**1) Endothelial Injury**
- Endothelin,
- Vascular Spasm

**2) Exposure**
- Damaged
- Endothelial Cells
- Von Willebrand's
- Factor

**3) Adhesion**
- Platelet
- GP1B

**4) Activation**
- Collagen
- Serotonin
- VWF
- Ca2+
- Adenosine
- Diphosphate (ADP)
- Blood
- Thromboxane A2
- Unbound Platelets
- at Injury Site

**5) Aggregation**
- Fibrinogen
- GPIB/IIIA
- Platelet Plug

- **Hemophilia A:** Deficiency of factor VIII (XR).
- **Hemophilia B:** Deficiency of factor IX (XR).
- **Hemophilia C:** Deficiency of XI (AR).

**Thrombogenesis**
Refer Image 2.1

- Thrombogenesis refers to the physiological process which leads to the formation of the blood clot.
- In an exam POV, the most important knowledge to be gained here is the action of various drugs. In the given flowchart, focus on the blocking sites of different drugs:
