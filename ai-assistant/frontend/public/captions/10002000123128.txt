GRAVE'S DISEASE
+
Definition
•
•
•
•
•
Grave's disease is an immune system disorder and it results in
the excess production of thyroid hormones causing
hyperthyroidism.
It is an autoimmune disease.
Sings and symptoms of Grave's disease can be wide ranging.
Treatment aims at reducing the amount of thyroid hormones
that the body produces and to lessen the symptoms caused by
the condition.
Grave's disease is also known as "Toxic diffuse goiter".
About 25 to 30% of the patients suffer from eye problems.
The exact cause though is not known for sure; it is believed to
be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
Etiology
•
•
•
•
•
Human leukocyte antigen DR (Mostly DR3) plays a role in
this.
Genes involved include those for:
o Thyroglobulin
• Thyrotropin receptor
• Protein tyrosine phosphatase non receptor type 22
(PTPN22)
○ Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4
Risk Factors
•
•
•
•
•
•
Family history of thyroid disease.
Smoking cigarettes
Sex of the individual (More common among women)
Pregnancy
Emotional or physical stress.
Autoimmune diseases like:
o Rheumatoid arthritis
o Lupus
o Celiac disease
o Vitiligo
o Type 1 diabetes
Epidemiology
•
•
•
•
Grave's disease mostly affects females than males.
Mostly seen in people between 30 to 50 years.
It can also affect children and older adults.
Occurs in 0.5% of people.
•
•
•
The exact cause of Grave's disease is not known.
•
•
•
Life time risk for women: Around 3%
•
•
Life time risk for men: Around 0.5%
•
•
•
The body produces IgG autoantibodies which are directed
against the thyrotropin receptor.
These antibodies cause hyperthyroidism by binding and in
turn stimulating the TSHr.
The TSHr is expressed on the thyroid follicular cells of the
thyroid gland.
The chronic stimulation leads to an increase in the production
ofT3 and T4.
This in turn causes hyperthyroidism and the enlargement of
thyroid gland which becomes visible as goiter.
Swelling of the eyeballs is a result of the binding of the
antibodies to the extraocular muscles.
•
Orange peel skin is caused due to the infiltration of antibodies
under the skin which causes inflammatory reaction and
fibrous plaques.
