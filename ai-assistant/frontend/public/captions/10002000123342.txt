 The image shows a table that compares the gram stain, culture test, and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) results for gram-negative diplococci and gram-positive cocci. 

The gram stain results show that gram-negative diplococci are seen inside the polymorphonuclear leukocytes, while gram-positive cocci are not. 

The culture test results show that gram-negative diplococci can be cultured on Thayer Martin Medium, while gram-positive cocci can be cultured on blood agar. 

The NAAT results show that both gram-negative diplococci and gram-positive cocci can be detected using this test.

The image also shows a flowchart that outlines the treatment for uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis. 

The flowchart shows that the treatment of choice for uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis is ceftriaxone 250 mg IM stat + azithromycin 1 g. 

If ceftriaxone is not available, cefixime 400 mg (oral) + azithromycin 1 g can be used.

The flowchart also shows that patients should be tested for chlamydia and syphilis and treated accordingly.
