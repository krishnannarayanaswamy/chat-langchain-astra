Warning Signs of Head and Neck Cancer
- Not all cancers present with symptoms at early stages!
  - Hoarseness
  - Erythroplasia
  - Referred otalgia
  - Persistent sore throat
  - Epistaxis
  - Nasal obstruction
  - Serous otitis media
  - Neck mass
  - Non-healing ulcer

Laryngeal Carcinoma
- It is a squamous cell carcinoma
- It mostly affects males

Etiology

  - HPV 6 and 11: They cause respiratory papillomatosis leading to a predisposition to carcinoma

Types of Laryngeal Carcinoma
- Anatomy
  - False cord
  - Ventricle
  - Thyroid cartilage
  - Supraglottis
  - True cord
- The pharynx is divided into three parts:
  - Glottis
  - Subglottis
  - Cricoid cartilage
- Supraglottis: The part of the larynx that lies above the vocal cords
- Glottis: The part of the larynx that lies at the level of vocal cords and 1 cm below.
- Subglottis: The part of the larynx that lied 1 cm below the level of coal cords to the level of the cricoid cartilage.
- According to the site of malignancy, carcinomas can be divided into supraglottic, glottic, and subglottic carcinomas.
- The most common carcinoma is glottic carcinoma
- It is followed by supraglottic carcinoma
- The least common carcinoma is subglottic carcinoma

One Liner
- Lymph node metastasis in the neck in almost never seen with glottic carcinoma
- The highest lymph node involvement is seen in subglottic and supraglottic carcinoma
