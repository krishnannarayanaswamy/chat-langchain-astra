 The image is about Nephrotic Syndrome, a group of symptoms that causes the body to excrete too much protein in the urine. It is often caused by damage to small blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste and excess water from the blood.
The incidence of nephrotic syndrome varies across different age groups, with a higher prevalence in children, particularly between 2 and 6 years of age. The condition affects both males and females but tends to be more common in males.
Nephrotic syndrome results from damage to the glomeruli, the clusters of tiny blood vessels in the kidneys responsible for filtering waste, excess water, and electrolytes from the blood to form urine. This damage leads to increased permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier, allowing larger molecules, such as proteins, to pass through into the urine. The loss of proteins, particularly albumin, from the blood causes a decrease in plasma oncotic pressure, which contributes to fluid retention and edema. Additionally, the loss of proteins can stimulate the liver to produce more proteins, including lipoproteins, leading to hyperlipidemia (elevated blood lipid levels). The underlying cause of the glomerular damage can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to various diseases, such as diabetes, autoimmune disorders, infections, or exposure to certain medications or toxins.
The signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include proteinuria (excessive protein loss in the urine), hypoalbuminemia (low blood albumin levels), edema (swelling caused by fluid retention), hyperlipidemia (elevated blood lipid levels), fatigue and weakness, foamy urine, and increased susceptibility to infections.
Thrombotic complications, anorexia, and weight loss are also possible.
The features of nephrotic syndrome include hyponatremia (low sodium levels), hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, hyperlipidemia, renal vein thrombosis, orbital edema, thromboembolism, infection, and coagulability.
There are two types of nephrotic syndrome: primary and secondary. Primary nephrotic syndrome is caused by damage to the glomeruli themselves, while secondary nephrotic syndrome is caused by an underlying condition that damages the glomeruli.
The treatment of nephrotic syndrome depends on the cause. In some cases, treatment may not be necessary. In other cases, treatment may include medications to reduce proteinuria, lower blood pressure, and improve kidney function.
Preventing nephrotic syndrome is not always possible. However, some things can be done to reduce the risk of developing the condition, such as avoiding exposure to toxins and infections, maintaining a healthy weight, and controlling blood pressure and blood sugar levels.
