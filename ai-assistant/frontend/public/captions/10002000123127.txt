 The image is a table that summarizes the medical history, physical exam, blood tests, radioiodine scan and uptake test, and thyroid ultrasound that are used to diagnose hyperthyroidism. 

Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including weight loss, increased heart rate, and anxiety.

The medical history and physical exam can provide clues to the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. For example, a person with hyperthyroidism may have a rapid heart rate, warm and moist skin, and a tremor in their hands.

Blood tests can also be used to diagnose hyperthyroidism. These tests measure the levels of thyroid hormones in the blood.

The radioiodine scan and uptake test is a nuclear medicine procedure that is used to evaluate the function of the thyroid gland. This test involves injecting a small amount of radioactive iodine into the body and then using a gamma camera to measure the amount of iodine that is taken up by the thyroid gland.

The thyroid ultrasound is a painless procedure that uses sound waves to create images of the thyroid gland. This test can be used to identify thyroid nodules or other abnormalities.
