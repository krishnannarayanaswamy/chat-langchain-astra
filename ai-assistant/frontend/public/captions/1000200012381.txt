CYSTIC FIBROSIS
+
•
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder
characterised by the dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein.
This results in the accumulation of viscous mucus in the
respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, leading to chronic
respiratory infections, pancreatic insufficiency, and
malabsorption of essential nutrients.
Epidemiology
•
Cystic fibrosis is a prevalent genetic disorder affecting
approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide, with the
highest incidence found among Caucasians of Northern
European descent.
Aetiology and Genetics
•
•
CF is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation
in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR) gene.
The AF508 mutation, prevalent in cystic fibrosis, involves
the removal of three nucleotides, causing the loss of
phenylalanine at the protein's 508th position.
This mutation disrupts the CFTR protein's structure and
function, leading to disease manifestations.
Pathophysiology and Diagnosis
Refer Flow Chart 24.1
Clinical Features
•
•
Respiratory system:
○ Persistent cough
○ Recurrent respiratory infections, particularly involving
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus
O Bronchiectasis
○ Nasal polyps
O Sinusitis
• Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
○ Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
Gastrointestinal system:
• Pancreatic insufficiency, leading to malabsorption of
nutrients, particularly fats
○ Steatorrhea (fatty, foul-smelling stools)
○ Rectal prolapse
○ Biliary cirrhosis
•
•
Reproductive system:
• Infertility in males due to the congenital bilateral absence
of the vas deferens
• Infertility or reduced fertility in females due to thick
cervical mucus
Endocrine system:
o Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD)
Other manifestations:
• Digital clubbing
○ Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS)
o Meconium ileus in newborns
• Electrolyte imbalances, particularly during periods of
dehydration or heat stress
