 ## Laryngeal cancer
### Etiology
- Most common in males
- Risk factors: smoking, alcohol, asbestos, nickel, wood dust
- HPV-16 and HPV-18 are associated with a subset of laryngeal cancers, particularly in younger patients

### Clinical presentation
- Hoarseness
- Dysphagia
- Odynophagia
- Otalgia
- Neck mass

### Physical examination
- Indirect laryngoscopy: visualization of the larynx with a mirror
- Direct laryngoscopy: visualization of the larynx with a rigid scope
- Palpation of the neck: to assess for lymphadenopathy

### Imaging
- CT scan of the neck and chest: to assess for the extent of the tumor and to identify any metastatic disease
- MRI of the neck: to assess for the extent of the tumor and to identify any metastatic disease
- PET scan: to assess for the presence of metastatic disease

### Staging
The staging of laryngeal cancer is based on the TNM system. The T stage describes the size and location of the tumor, the N stage describes the presence and extent of regional lymph node involvement, and the M stage describes the presence of distant metastases.
- T stage
 - T1: Tumor confined to the vocal cords
 - T2: Tumor invades the vocal cords and/or the supraglottic or subglottic regions
 - T3: Tumor invades the thyroid cartilage or the cricoid cartilage
 - T4: Tumor invades the surrounding structures, such as the skin, muscles, or bones of the neck
- N stage
 - N0: No regional lymph node involvement
 - N1: Metastasis to a single ipsilateral lymph node
 - N2: Metastasis to multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes
 - N3: Metastasis to contralateral lymph nodes or to lymph nodes in the neck
- M stage
 - M0: No distant metastases
 - M1: Distant metastases

### Treatment
The treatment of laryngeal cancer depends on the stage of the disease.
- Early-stage laryngeal cancer (T1-T2N0M0)
 - Radiation therapy
 - Surgery
 - Laser surgery
 - Chemotherapy
 - Immunotherapy
- Advanced-stage laryngeal cancer (T3-T4N0-3M0 or any TNM stage with distant metastases)
 - Surgery
 - Radiation therapy
 - Chemotherapy
 - Immunotherapy
 - Targeted therapy

### Prognosis
The prognosis of laryngeal cancer depends on the stage of the disease. The 5-year survival rate for early-stage laryngeal cancer is greater than 90%. The 5-year survival rate for advanced-stage laryngeal cancer is less than 50%.
