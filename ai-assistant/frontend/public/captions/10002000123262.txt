 The image is a diagram showing the time course of a migraine attack. The x-axis shows the time in hours, and the y-axis shows the severity of the headache. The migraine attack is typically preceded by a prodrome, which can last for a few hours to days. The prodrome may include symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and food cravings. The aura typically lasts for 5 to 60 minutes and may include symptoms such as visual disturbances, tingling or numbness in the face or hands, and difficulty speaking. The attack itself typically lasts for 4 to 72 hours and may include symptoms such as severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. The postdrome may last for 24 to 48 hours and may include symptoms such as fatigue, headache, and difficulty concentrating.
    There are a number of different treatments for migraines, including medications and lifestyle changes. Medications can be used to relieve the symptoms of an attack, prevent attacks from occurring, and reduce the severity of attacks. Lifestyle changes that can help to reduce the frequency and severity of migraines include avoiding triggers, getting regular exercise, and eating a healthy diet.
    Table 71.2 lists the different types of medications that are used to treat migraines, their routes of administration, and their side effects. The most common type of medication used to treat migraines are triptans. Triptans are a class of drugs that work by constricting blood vessels in the brain. They are typically taken orally, but can also be administered subcutaneously or nasally. Triptans are generally well-tolerated, but can cause side effects such as nausea, dizziness, and chest tightness.
    Ergotamines are another type of medication that is used to treat migraines. Ergotamines work by constricting blood vessels and stimulating the central nervous system. They are typically taken orally, but can also be administered rectally or sublingually. Ergotamines are generally not as well-tolerated as triptans, and can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle pain.
    NSAIDs are a type of medication that is used to treat pain and inflammation. They are typically taken orally. NSAIDs are generally well-tolerated, but can cause side effects such as stomach upset, heartburn, and diarrhea.
    Acetaminophen is a type of medication that is used to treat pain and fever. It is typically taken orally. Acetaminophen is generally well-tolerated, but can cause side effects such as liver damage and allergic reactions.
