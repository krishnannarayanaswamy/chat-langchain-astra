 The image shows the main areas of muscle weakness in different types of muscular dystrophy. Muscular dystrophy is a group of genetic disorders that cause progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. The different types of muscular dystrophy are classified according to the pattern of muscle weakness.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common type of muscular dystrophy. It is an X-linked recessive disorder that affects boys. DMD is caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene. Dystrophin is a protein that is essential for the proper function of muscle cells. Without dystrophin, muscle cells are unable to contract and relax properly, which leads to muscle weakness and degeneration.

Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a rare type of muscular dystrophy that affects both boys and girls. EDMD is caused by mutations in the emerin gene. Emerin is a protein that is found in the nucleus of muscle cells. Mutations in the emerin gene lead to the production of a defective emerin protein, which disrupts the normal function of muscle cells.

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a group of muscular dystrophies that are characterized by weakness in the muscles of the limbs. LGMD is caused by mutations in a variety of genes. The different types of LGMD are classified according to the specific gene that is mutated.

Fascioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a type of muscular dystrophy that affects the muscles of the face, shoulders, and upper arms. FSHD is caused by a deletion in the D4Z4 gene. The D4Z4 gene is located on chromosome 4. The deletion in the D4Z4 gene leads to a decrease in the production of a protein called DUX4. DUX4 is a protein that is essential for the proper development of muscle cells.

Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare type of muscular dystrophy that affects the muscles of the eyes and throat. OPMD is caused by a mutation in the PABPN1 gene. The PABPN1 gene is located on chromosome 14. The mutation in the PABPN1 gene leads to the production of a defective PABPN1 protein, which disrupts the normal function of muscle cells.
