 The image is a flowchart that shows the possible causes of Cushing's syndrome. 

Cushing's syndrome is a condition that is caused by the body producing too much of the hormone cortisol. This can be due to a number of different causes, including:
- A pituitary tumor
- An adrenal tumor
- Other or unknown causes

The most common cause of Cushing's syndrome is a pituitary tumor. This type of tumor produces a hormone called ACTH, which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol.

Another possible cause of Cushing's syndrome is an adrenal tumor. This type of tumor produces cortisol directly.

In some cases, Cushing's syndrome can be caused by other or unknown causes. This can include taking certain medications, such as glucocorticoids, which are used to treat a variety of conditions, including asthma and arthritis.

The symptoms of Cushing's syndrome can include:
- Weight gain
- High blood pressure
- Diabetes
- Osteoporosis
- Muscle weakness
- Mood changes

If you think you may have Cushing's syndrome, it is important to see your doctor right away. Early diagnosis and treatment can help to prevent serious complications.

The treatment for Cushing's syndrome depends on the cause of the condition. If the cause is a pituitary tumor, surgery may be necessary to remove the tumor. If the cause is an adrenal tumor, surgery may also be necessary to remove the tumor. In some cases, medication may be used to treat Cushing's syndrome.
