 The image is a flowchart that describes the process of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 

The process starts with the accumulation of genetic abnormalities in the original myeloid precursor cell ("Blasts"). 

These blasts then divide and accumulate in the bone marrow, expanding the marrow and pushing on the bone. 

As the blasts fill up the bone marrow, they spill out into the blood, causing a decrease in the number of normal blood cells. 

This can lead to anemia, fatigue, shortness of breath, pallor, easy bruising and petechiae on the skin. 

The blasts can also secrete excessive amounts of coagulation-promoting cytokines into circulation, which can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

In addition, the high turnover of these cancerous cells can lead to the release of intracellular contents (uric acid, K+, LDH) into the plasma, which can cause tumor lysis syndrome and acute kidney injury.
