 ## **28. MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION**
**Introduction**
- A myocardial infarction occurs when there's a blockage of blood flow to the myocardium, almost always a medical emergency.

**Epidemiology**
- Myocardial infarction is classified as very common.
- It affects more than 10 million people per year in India. 

**Etiology**
- Most myocardial infarction are stemmed from underlying coronary artery disease.
- Coronary atherosclerosis
- Thromboemboli
- Coronary artery spasm
- Myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch, for example, due to severe anemia
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Severe aortic stenosis

**Risk Factors**
- Diabetes
- High Blood Pressure
- Smoking
- Overweight
- High Cholesterol
- Family History

**Pathophysiology**
- Coronary artery occlusion: usually a partial or endothelial infarction manifesting as unstable angina or STEMI
- Complete coronary artery occlusion (usually a trans-mural infarction manifesting as Type 1 MI)
- Oxygen supply and demand mismatch
- Nonischemic myocardial injury (such as secondary to inflammatory cytokines)

**Signs and Symptoms**
Refer Diagram 28.1

**Clinical Findings**
Refer Flow Chart 28.1

**Complications**
Refer Chart 28.2

**Diagnosis**
- A primary diagnosis can be made from physical findings itself.
- However, for a confirmatory diagnosis, ECG and lab results are used.
Refer Flow Chart 28.3

**Treatment**
Refer Flow Chart 28.4

**Prevention**
- Primary prevention: Avoidance of the modifiable risk factors for atherosclerosis such as:
 - Regular exercise
 - Smoking cessation
 - Management of hypertension and hyperlipidemias
- Secondary prevention:
 - Lifestyle modifications
 - Statins
 - Long-dose low-dose aspirin
 - Dual antiplatelet therapy
 - Beta-blockers unless contraindicated
