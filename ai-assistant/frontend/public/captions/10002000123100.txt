Topic: Myocardial Infarction

This is a medical illustration showing the complications of a myocardial infarction (MI), which is a heart attack. 

The complications are listed in the center of the image and are as follows:
- Arrhythmias
- Embolization
- Pump dysfunction
- Congestive heart failure
- Atrial Fibrillation
- Ventricular aneurysm
- Pericarditis
- Cardiac tamponade

The image shows the relationship between the complications and how they can lead to each other. For example, a myocardial infarction can lead to arrhythmias, which can lead to pump dysfunction, which can lead to congestive heart failure.

The image also shows the different types of complications that can occur, such as embolization, which is when a blood clot forms in the heart and travels to another part of the body, or pericarditis, which is an inflammation of the sac that surrounds the heart.

The text on the image provides more information about each of the complications, such as the symptoms, causes, and treatments.
