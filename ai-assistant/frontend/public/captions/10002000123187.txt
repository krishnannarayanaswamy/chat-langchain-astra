Renal sarcoma is a type of cancer that starts in the kidney. It is a rare cancer, accounting for about 1% of all kidney cancers. Renal sarcoma is more common in children than in adults.

The clinical features of renal sarcoma include:
- Blood in the urine
- Pain in the back or side
- Loss of appetite
- Fever
- Tiredness
- Unexplained weight loss

Renal sarcoma is diagnosed with a combination of imaging tests and a biopsy. Imaging tests, such as an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI, can help to identify the tumor and determine its size and location. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small sample of tissue is removed from the tumor and examined under a microscope. This can help to confirm the diagnosis of renal sarcoma and rule out other possible causes of the symptoms.

Renal sarcoma is treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Surgery is the most common treatment for renal sarcoma. The goal of surgery is to remove the tumor completely. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are used to kill any cancer cells that may remain after surgery.

The prognosis for renal sarcoma depends on the stage of the cancer at the time of diagnosis. The earlier the cancer is diagnosed and treated, the better the prognosis. The 5-year survival rate for renal sarcoma is about 60%.
