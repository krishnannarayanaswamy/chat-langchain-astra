 The image is a flowchart that shows the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction. It starts with local necrosis of myocardial tissue, which leads to the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This, in turn, causes the migration of neutrophils and monocytes to the area, which further contributes to the inflammatory response. The inflammatory response can lead to the formation of a thrombus, which can occlude the coronary artery and lead to myocardial ischemia. If the ischemia is prolonged, it can lead to myocardial infarction.
    The flowchart also shows the timeline of events that occur after a myocardial infarction. Within 3 hours of a myocardial infarction, there is an elevation of cardiac troponins and CK-MB in the blood. The levels of these biomarkers peak at 6-12 hours and then slowly decline over the next few days.
    The ECG changes that occur after a myocardial infarction are also shown in the flowchart. There is typically an ST-segment elevation in the leads that are facing the area of infarction. This elevation typically occurs within 6 hours of the infarction and lasts for 1-2 days.
    The prognosis of a myocardial infarction depends on the size and location of the infarction. A small infarction that does not involve the left ventricle may have a good prognosis, while a large infarction that involves the left ventricle may have a poor prognosis.
