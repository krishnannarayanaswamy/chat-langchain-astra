 **Lichen Planus**

- Lichen Planus is an important cause of Scarring alopecia
- The hair follicles are destroyed
- Scarring occurs with no growth of hair
- This is irreversible

**Other Types of Lichen Planus**

- Actinic Lichen Planus
 - Associated with solar exposure
 - Seen in photo exposed areas
- Hypertrophic Lichen Planus
 - Lichen Planus is thickened. (Appears Hypertrophic)
- Lichen Planus pemphigoids
 - Combination of Lichen Planus and over that we get pemphigoids regions.
- Annular Lichen Planus

**In Tuberculosis**

- Lichen Scrofulosorum and Lichen Amyloidosis
 - These are not Lichen Planus
 - Lichen is something which is Purplish or has a Lichenified or lichenoid histology.

**Histopathology**

- In Stratum Corneum:
 - Hyperkeratosis (increased thickening)
- In Stratum Granulosum
 - Hypergranulosis and this is typically focal, wedge shaped hypergranulosis.
- In Starting Spinosum:
 - Acanthosis is seen

- The most important changes occur in Stratum Basale
- The infiltrate targets the Stratum Basale layer
- Basal Cell Degeneration is seen
- Keratinocyte turns into apoptotic bodies (undergoes apoptosis) which are called civatte bodies
- Melanin (dendritic melanocytes) also targeted
- They release their melanin which falls into the dermis
- Leads to melanin incontinence
- Melanin is engulfed by Macrophages forms melanophages
- The rete ridges are saw toothed
- Max Joseph Space: Space which is created between epidermis and dermis by the infiltrate of lymphocytes
- The Basale cell Degeneration and the infiltrate in dermis are together referred to as Interface Dermatitis

**Treatment**

- Treatments we use in Lichen Planus can be
 - Tropical
   - Corticosteroids
   - Calcineurin Inhibitors (such as Tacrolimus, Pimecrolimus)
   - Antihistamine
  - If oral mucosa is affected, you need to give local anesthetics
 - Intralesional
   - For Hypertrophic lesion: Intralesional injections of Corticosteroids
 - Systemic
   - Systemic treatment for more severe form
   - Commonly used systemic agents are:
     - Oral Corticosteroids
     - Dapsone
     - HCQS
     - Azathioprine
     - MMF (Mycophenolate mofetil)
- All these can be used and does systemic therapy of Lichen
- Phototherapy:
 - NBUVB Phototherapy
 - It is used especially in children who have a lot of regions in the body
