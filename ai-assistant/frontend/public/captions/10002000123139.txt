 **Pathophysiology**
**Type 1 diabetes**
- In response to the glucose stimulus, beta-cells of the islets of Langerhans (in the pancreas) synthesize insulin.
- The destruction of the insulin-producing cells causes type 1 diabetes (TD1).
- The autoimmune destruction of the beta-cells is believed to be triggered by an infective or environmental stimulus in genetically predisposed individuals.
- After approximately 80% of pancreatic beta-cells have been destroyed, clinical signs and symptoms begin to develop.
- This often gets manifested at a time of increased insulin demand.

**Type 2 diabetes**
- Malfunctioning of the feedback loops between insulin action and secretion causes the blood glucose level to increase manifold.
- Beta cell dysfunction:
 - In this case, insulin secretion is reduced.
 - This eventually limits the body's capacity to maintain physiological glucose levels.
- Insulin resistance:
 - It leads to increased glucose production in the liver.
 - Glucose uptake by muscle, liver, and adipose tissue will be reduced.
- Beta cell dysfunction is more severe than insulin resistance.
- When both are present simultaneously, hyperglycemia will be amplified, leading to the development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

**Diagnosis**
**Clinical Features**
**Type 1 diabetes mellitus**
- The increased appetite (especially after eating)
- Frequent urination
- Extreme thirst
- Dry mouth
- Upset stomach
- Vomiting
- Weight loss
- Blurry vision
- Fatigue
- Frequent infections of the skin, urinary tract, and vagina
- Labored breathing (Kussmaul respiration)
- Mood swings and irritability
- Bedwetting among children is also seen.
- Emergency signs are the following:
 - Rapid breathing
 - Shaking and confusion
 - Loss of consciousness
 - Stomach pain

**Type 2 diabetes mellitus**
- Increased thirst
- Frequent urination
- Irritability
- Blurry vision
- Fatigue
- Recurring yeast infections
- Tingling or numbness in hands or feet
- Impaired wound healing
- Unexplained weight loss
- Increased incidence of infections
- Increased appetite

**Important Information**
- Acanthosis nigricans
 - It is a condition in which dark rashes around the neck or armpits develop.
 - This is usually considered a sign of insulin resistance.
 - Consultation should be taken as soon as possible in such a case.

**Investigations of type 1 diabetes mellitus**
- Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test:
 - This test can estimate and provide the average blood sugar level over the past 3 months.
 - It measures the amount of blood sugar attached to the oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cells (RBCs).
 - The higher the blood sugar level, the higher the hemoglobin (Hb) attached to the sugar.
 - An HbA1c level of 6.5% or more on two tests marks a positive result.
