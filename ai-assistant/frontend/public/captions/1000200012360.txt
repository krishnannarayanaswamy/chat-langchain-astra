 The image is a flowchart that shows the relationship between environmental factors, genetic susceptibility, and behavioral factors in the development of ulcerative colitis (UC). The flowchart starts with environmental factors, which can include diet, bacteria, viruses, and drugs. These factors can interact with genetic susceptibility to cause an immune response against the GI tract. This immune response can lead to inflammation of the GI tract epithelial lining, which is the start of UC. The inflammation can then cause a variety of symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. The inflammation can also lead to complications such as anemia and liver damage.
