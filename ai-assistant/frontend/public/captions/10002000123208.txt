 The image is a flowchart that shows the typical presentation of a man with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The flowchart starts with the patient presenting with LUTS. The patient is then assessed with a history, physical examination, and urinalysis. If the patient has mild symptoms, they are経過観察. If the patient has moderate to severe symptoms, they are further evaluated with other diagnostic tests, such as cystoscopy and urodynamics. If the patient has severe symptoms and BPH complications, they are treated with surgery.

The flowchart also shows the different treatment options for BPH. The treatment options include alpha-adrenergic antagonists, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, and combination therapy. The choice of treatment depends on the severity of the patient's symptoms and the presence of BPH complications.
