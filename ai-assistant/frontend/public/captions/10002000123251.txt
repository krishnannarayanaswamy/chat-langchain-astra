 The image is a table that lists the 12 cranial nerves, their names, and their functions. The cranial nerves are numbered I to XII, and each nerve is listed in a separate row. The first column lists the name of the nerve, the second column lists the function of the nerve, and the third column lists the number of the nerve.

The cranial nerves are the nerves that emerge from the brain and travel through the skull to innervate the head and neck. They are responsible for a variety of functions, including vision, hearing, smell, taste, and movement.

The first cranial nerve is the olfactory nerve, which is responsible for the sense of smell. The second cranial nerve is the optic nerve, which is responsible for vision. The third cranial nerve is the oculomotor nerve, which is responsible for controlling the movement of the eyes. The fourth cranial nerve is the trochlear nerve, which is also responsible for controlling the movement of the eyes. The fifth cranial nerve is the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for sensation in the face and for controlling the muscles of chewing. The sixth cranial nerve is the abducens nerve, which is responsible for controlling the movement of the eyes. The seventh cranial nerve is the facial nerve, which is responsible for controlling the muscles of the face and for taste. The eighth cranial nerve is the acoustic nerve, which is responsible for hearing and balance. The ninth cranial nerve is the glossopharyngeal nerve, which is responsible for taste and for controlling the muscles of the throat. The tenth cranial nerve is the vagus nerve, which is responsible for controlling the muscles of the heart, lungs, and digestive system. The eleventh cranial nerve is the accessory nerve, which is responsible for controlling the muscles of the neck and shoulders. The twelfth cranial nerve is the hypoglossal nerve, which is responsible for controlling the muscles of the tongue.
