 The image is about Epiglottitis.
Epiglottitis is an acute inflammatory condition confined to supraglottic structures.
The structures involved are epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids.
The inflammation may obstruct the airway.
This condition was initially caused by H. Influenzae, but since the introduction of vaccines, it is now commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.
The age group commonly affected is 3-6 years.

Symptoms:
- Inspiratory stridor
- Odynophagia
- Drooling of saliva
- No change in voice
- No cough

Diagnosis:
Lateral view X-ray of the neck shows a thumb sign.

Treatment:
- Antibiotics (IV ceftriaxone)
- Steroids
- Nebulization with racemic adrenaline (a vasoconstrictor that reduces airway edema)
- Tracheostomy if stridor is present

Additional information:
- Epiglottitis is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment.
- If the airway is completely obstructed, a tracheostomy may be necessary to save the patient's life.
