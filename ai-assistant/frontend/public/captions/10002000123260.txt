MIGRAINE
+
Introduction
•
•
•
Migraine is one of the common causes of recurrent
headaches.
According to IHS, migraine constitutes 16% of primary
headaches.
Migraine is an intense throbbing or pulsing headache,
commonly in one area of the head, but it could be in both.
Sometimes it is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and
extreme sensitivity to light and sound.
Migraine attacks last for hours to days; a migraine is a severe
pain or headache that makes you go to a dark, quiet room and
lie there.
Migraine is underdiagnosed and under-treated.
Pathophysiology
1. Vascular Theory
•
It suggests that changes in the size and tone of blood vessels
in the brain cause migraine headaches. This idea holds that
during a migraine attack, a sudden constriction (narrowing)
of blood vessels in the brain is followed by a dilatation
(widening) of the same vessels. The ensuing swelling places
pressure on the surrounding tissues, resulting in pain,
throbbing, and other migraine symptoms.
This notion is reinforced by studies demonstrating that blood
arteries in the brain change during a migraine attack. It has
been discovered that the blood arteries in the brain constrict
first, reducing blood flow and causing the aura phase of the
migraine, then expanding, increasing blood flow and causing
the headache phase.
2. Serotonin Theory
•
•
Decreased serotonin levels linked to migraine.
Specific serotonin receptors are found in the blood vessels of
the brain.

Clinical presentation of migraine
The clinical presentation of migraine can vary between
individuals, but several hallmark features are commonly seen.
•
The most common type of migraine is migraine without aura,
accounting for about 80% of cases. This type of migraine
typically presents with a moderate to severe headache, often
described as pulsating or throbbing and is typically located
on one side of the head. The headache can last anywhere from
•
•
a few hours to several days and is often accompanied by other
symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light
and sound.
Sometimes, a migraine may be preceded by an aura, sensory
disturbances that occur shortly before the headache. The aura
typically lasts for 20-60 minutes and can include visual
disturbances such as flashes of light or blind spots and other
sensory symptoms such as tingling or numbness in the face
or hands.
In addition to the headache and accompanying symptoms,
migraine can cause other symptoms, such as fatigue,
difficulty concentrating, and mood changes. These
symptoms may persist even after the headache has subsided.
Migraine Triggers
Triggers for the migraine headache can be remembered using
the mnemonic "STRESSED"
•
•
•
Stress
Tension
Rapid changes in sleep pattern
Environmental factors (such as weather changes)
•
Skipping meals
• Excessive noise
•
Dental problems.
Classification:
• According to the Headache Classification Committee of the
IHS, Migraine has been classified as:
1. Migraine without aura (common migraine)
2. Migraine with aura (classic migraine)
3. Complicated migraine
Diagnosis
•
Medical History
•
Headache diary
• Migraine triggers
• Investigations are usually advised to rule out other causes of
headaches and are not needed to diagnose migraine.
O EEG
OCT Brain
O MRI
Management
•
Long term treatment
• Reducing the attack frequency and severity.
