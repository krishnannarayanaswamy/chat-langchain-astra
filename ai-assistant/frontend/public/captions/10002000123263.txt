 + 72 EPILEPSY

Introduction
- Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder which causes a predisposition to seizures and is defined by one of the following conditions:
  - Two unprovoked or reflex seizures with a time gap of more than 24 hours.
  - One unprovoked or reflex seizure is caused in individuals having a high risk of subsequent seizures, for example, after traumatic brain injury, CNS infection, or stroke.
  - It does not include single seizures or multiple provoked or triggered seizures by metabolic disturbance or trauma, for example, febrile seizures.

- A seizure occurs due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain that causes loss of consciousness, convulsions, and lapses in consciousness.
- A provoked seizure occurs due to various triggers and conditions like stroke, traumatic brain injury, and alcohol withdrawal.
- Whereas unprovoked seizures occur in the absence of an identifiable cause.

The complications of seizures can be acute or chronic.
- Acute complications include:
  - Physical trauma
  - Central nervous system injury
  - Status epilepticus
- Chronic complications of seizures include:
  - Anxiety
  - Depression
  - Psychosis
  - Sleep disorders
  - Sudden unexpected death

A seizure does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy.

Epilepsy is common in the general population. It is a symptom, not a disease.
It reflects a broad range of underlying neuropathology and can be successfully treated with medicine in most patients, and associated problems can lead to activity restrictions and significant psychosocial burdens.

Causes of Epilepsy:
- Degenerative (4%)
- Tumors (4%)
- Infectious (3%)
- Trauma (6%)
- Congenital (8%)
- Vascular (10%)
- Idiopathic (65%)

Causes of Epilepsy According to Age Groups:
- Infants (less than 6 months old):
  - Genetic
  - Perinatal injury
  - Metabolic disorders, for example, Phenylketonuria, hypocalcemia, and hypoglycemia.
  - West syndrome
- Children (6 months to 10 years old):
  - Infection causing febrile seizures
  - Congenital brain malformations, for example, cortical dysgenesis
  - Genetic
  - Accidental drug intake
  - Metabolic disorder
  - Trauma
- Adults:
  - Tumors
  - Trauma
  - Stroke
  - Infection
  - Substance abuse
- Older adults:
  - Stroke
  - Tumor
  - Trauma
  - Metabolic infections
  - Abscesses
  - Neurodegenerative disorders

Signs & Symptoms
- Loss of consciousness
- Weakness
- Anxiety
