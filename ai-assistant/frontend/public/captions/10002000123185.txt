 The image is a table that shows the likelihood of developing kidney cancer according to age and gender. The table is divided into three age groups: 0-49 years, 50-59 years, and 60-69 years. For each age group, the table shows the percentage of men and women who are likely to develop kidney cancer. The table also shows the lifetime risk of developing kidney cancer for both men and women.
The likelihood of developing kidney cancer increases with age. Men are more likely to develop kidney cancer than women. The lifetime risk of developing kidney cancer is 2.1% for men and 1.2% for women.
There are a number of risk factors for kidney cancer. These include smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, and kidney disease. Smoking is the most significant risk factor for kidney cancer. Obese people are also at an increased risk of developing kidney cancer. High blood pressure and kidney disease are also risk factors for kidney cancer.
If you have any of the risk factors for kidney cancer, it is important to talk to your doctor about screening options. Screening can help to detect kidney cancer early, when it is most treatable.
