End systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR)

1. End systole (AV closes)
2. MV opening
3. End-diastole (MV closes)
4. AV opens

Arterial elastance (Ea)

Increased SVR.
Decreased inotropy.

Ejection

Blood pressure

Stroke volume

End diastolic pressure-volume relationship (EDPVR)

Increased preload
Decreased preload
