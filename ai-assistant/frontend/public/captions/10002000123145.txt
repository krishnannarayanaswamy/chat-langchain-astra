 The image is about osteoporosis. It starts with the definition of osteoporosis, which is a bone disease caused by a decrease in bone mineral density and bone mass. The structure and strength of the bone changes, which increases the risk of fractures.

The etiology of osteoporosis includes changes in hormone levels, such as low estrogen levels post-menopause and low testosterone levels in men. Certain medical conditions, such as endocrine and hormonal diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis, can also increase the risk of osteoporosis. Long-term use of certain medications, such as glucocorticoids and proton pump inhibitors, can also increase the risk.

The epidemiology of osteoporosis shows that it is more prevalent among women than men, with an estimated 200 million people affected worldwide. The frequency of fractures is highest among postmenopausal women.

The risk factors for osteoporosis include sex, age, body size, race, and family history. Women are at higher risk than men due to their lower bone mass density. The risk increases with age as bone loss increases and new bone formation slows down. People with slender and thin bones are at higher risk than those with larger bones. White and Asian women are at higher risk than African women. A family history of osteoporosis or hip fracture also increases the risk.

Prevention of osteoporosis includes lifestyle modifications, such as proper physical exercise, avoiding heavy alcohol intake, and quitting smoking. Adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium throughout life is also important. Treatment for osteoporosis includes medications such as bisphosphonates, teriparatide, and raloxifene.
