 The image is a table that summarizes the stages of tubercular otitis media, a type of ear infection. The table has four columns: stage, pathology, symptoms, and signs.

The first stage is tubal occlusion, which is when the Eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the back of the throat, becomes blocked. This can lead to a negative pressure in the middle ear, which can cause the tympanic membrane (eardrum) to retract. Symptoms of tubal occlusion include mild deafness and earache. Signs of tubal occlusion include a retracted tympanic membrane.

The second stage is pre-suppuration, which is when the infection spreads to the middle ear. This can cause inflammation and the accumulation of fluid in the middle ear. Symptoms of pre-suppuration include fever, severe earache, and deafness. Signs of pre-suppuration include a bulging tympanic membrane.

The third stage is suppuration, which is when the infection progresses and pus forms in the middle ear. This can cause the tympanic membrane to rupture, which can lead to a decrease in symptoms. However, the infection can still spread to other parts of the body, such as the mastoid bone or the brain. Symptoms of suppuration include high-grade fever, excruciating earache, and deafness. Signs of suppuration include a small perforation in the tympanic membrane.

The fourth stage is resolution, which is when the infection clears up and the tympanic membrane heals. Symptoms of resolution include a decrease in pain and hearing loss. Signs of resolution include a healed tympanic membrane.
