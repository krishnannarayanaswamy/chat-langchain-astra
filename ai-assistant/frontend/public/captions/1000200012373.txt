 **22 ASTHMA**
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways
characterised by bronchial hyperresponsiveness, reversible
airflow obstruction, and airway inflammation.
This condition leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing,
coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath, with
varying severity and frequency among affected individuals.

**Epidemiology**
• Asthma is a prevalent global health concern, affecting an
estimated 339 million people worldwide across all age
groups, with a higher prevalence in children.
• The distribution of asthma varies by region, influenced by
factors such as genetics, environmental exposure, and
socioeconomic status.
• It affects more than 10 million cases per year in India.

**Triggers for asthma**
• Exposures to some viral infections in infancy.
• NSAIDs
• Irritants- cigarette smoking, air pollution, chemicals, etc.
• Viral upper respiratory infections.
• Allergens from dust, animal, fur, mold, etc.
• Heredity- Parents who have asthma.
• An inherited tendency to develop allergies, called atopy.

**Pathophysiology**
Refer Flow Chart 22.1

**Clinical Features**
Refer Flow Chart 22.2

**Diagnosis**
**Medical history
and physical
exam**
Diagnosis of asthma
• Recurrent episodes of wheezing,
coughing, chest tightness, and dyspnea;
family history of asthma or atopy
**Spirometry**
• Reduced FEV1/FVC ratio (<0.7),
indicating airflow obstruction
**Bronchodilator
reversibility test**
• ≥12% improvement in FEV1 after
bronchodilator administration
**Methacholine
challenge test**
• >20% decrease in FEV1 after
methacholine exposure, indicating
airway hyperresponsiveness
**Allergy testing**
• Positive results for specific allergens,
indicating allergic asthma

**Treatment**
Refer Table 22.1
**Management of asthma according to the severity**
• A-Adrenergics (Beta 2 agonists, albuterol)
• S- Steroids
• T-Theophylline
• H- Hydration
• M- Mask Oxygen
• A-Anticholinergics
Refer Flow Chart 22.3

**Acute asthma exacerbation**
**Triggers**
• Allergens (e.g., pollen, pet dander, mould)
• Respiratory infections (e.g., cold, flu)
• Air pollutants (e.g., smoke, chemical
fumes)
• Exercise or physical activity
• Weather changes (e.g., cold air, humidity)

**Clinical
Features**
• Increased wheezing
• Coughing, often worse at night
• Shortness of breath
• Chest tightness
• Tachypnea (rapid breathing)
• Use of accessory muscles for breathing

**Treatment**
• Oxygen therapy for hypoxia
• Short-acting beta-agonists (e.g., albuterol)
for immediate relief
• Inhaled anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium)
to reduce bronchoconstriction (in severe
cases)
• Systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone)
to reduce inflammation
• Intravenous magnesium sulphate for
severe exacerbations unresponsive to
initial treatments.
