 The image is about **Hypothyroidism.**
    
Definition
The thyroid gland is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of the neck. It produces hormones that regulate the body's metabolism. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough of these hormones. This can lead to a number of symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and depression.

**Important Information**
- Primary hypothyroidism is caused by damage to the thyroid gland itself.
- Central hypothyroidism is caused by a problem with the pituitary gland, which controls the thyroid gland.
- Congenital hypothyroidism is a rare condition in which a baby is born without a thyroid gland or with a thyroid gland that does not work properly.

**Etiology**
The most common cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system attacks the thyroid gland. Other causes include:
- Treatment for Graves' disease, an overactive thyroid condition
- Surgery to remove the thyroid gland
- Radiation therapy to the neck
- Certain medications, such as lithium and amiodarone
- Iodine deficiency

**Symptoms**
The symptoms of hypothyroidism can vary depending on the severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include:
- Fatigue
- Weight gain
- Constipation
- Depression
- Cold intolerance
- Dry skin
- Brittle hair
- Muscle weakness
- Slow heart rate
- Irregular menstrual cycles
- Infertility

**Diagnosis**
Hypothyroidism is diagnosed with a blood test that measures levels of thyroid hormones and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. In hypothyroidism, TSH levels are usually high, while thyroid hormone levels are low.

**Treatment**
The treatment for hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone replacement therapy. This medication is taken orally and helps to relieve the symptoms of hypothyroidism. Treatment for hypothyroidism usually involves taking thyroid hormone replacement medication. This medication is usually taken once a day and can help to improve symptoms of hypothyroidism.

**Prevention**
There is no known way to prevent hypothyroidism. However, early diagnosis and treatment can help to prevent serious complications.
