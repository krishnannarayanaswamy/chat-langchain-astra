 + 31 CARDIOMYOPATHY

Introduction
Cardiomyopathy is a serious medical condition of the heart, and the heart muscles become weak or inflamed. Due to this, the heart does not function the way it should, therefore hindering the pumping of blood. Eventually, this can lead to cardiac arrest or heart failure.
Cardiomyopathy can be classified as primary, i.e. there is no prominent cause, or secondary, i.e. cardiomyopathy may happen due to a cause.
The cause can be congenital heart disease, heart valve disease, viral infections, hypertension, coronary artery disease, etc.

Types of Cardiomyopathy
Types of cardiomyopathy include:
• Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: the heart muscle enlarges and thickens
• Dilated cardiomyopathy: the ventricles enlarge and weaken.
○ Restrictive cardiomyopathy: the ventricle stiffens.
○ Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia
○ Broken heart syndrome.

Refer Table 31.1

Causes of Cardiomyopathy
• Chronic high blood pressure
• History of myocardial infarction; the damaged heart muscle is replaced by scar tissue leading to cardiomyopathy
• Heart Valve Defects
• Viral myocarditis.
• Excessive alcohol consumption.
• Nutritional deficiencies.

Symptoms of Cardiomyopathy
• A patient suffering from cardiomyopathy may not experience any specific symptoms in the early stages of the disease.
• If the condition is not treated timely, it may get worse.
• In the advanced stage of this condition, a patient may experience the symptoms listed below:
o Shortness of breath; could be at rest or during exertion.
• Fatigue
• Peripheral edema; may present as swelling in the lower extremities
o Giddiness and lightheadedness
• Falling unconscious or Fainting spells
○ Palpitations

Differential Diagnosis of Cardiomyopathy
• Ischemic heart disease
• Valvular heart disease - mitral and aortic valves
• Pericarditis
• Pulmonary stenosis
• VSD

Diagnosis of Cardiomyopathy
• Physical exam
• Family history
• Blood test
• EKG
• Echocardiogram
• Stress test
• Genetic testing

Treatments for 'Cardiomyopathy'
• The treatment of cardiomyopathy involves identifying and treating the underlying cause.
• Healthy Lifestyle; eating a blanched nutritious diet and adopting physical activity as much as the patient can tolerate.
• Refraining from smoking, drinking, or drugs
• Medications can be given for symptomatic relief and include:
o Beta-blockers: Decrease the heart rate and reduce the workload.
○ ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs): These drugs cause vasodilation, reducing blood pressure and improving blood flow to the heart.
○ Diuretics: These medications help the body to get rid of excess fluid, reducing the workload on the heart and improving symptoms such as shortness of breath.
