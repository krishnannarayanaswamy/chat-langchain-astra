 The image is a table that summarizes the important information about diabetic retinopathy. It includes the classification of diabetic retinopathy, the symptoms of diabetic retinopathy, and the treatment for diabetic retinopathy.

Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in people with diabetes.

There are two main types of diabetic retinopathy: proliferative diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is the more severe type of diabetic retinopathy and it is characterized by the growth of new blood vessels in the retina. These new blood vessels can leak blood and fluid, which can lead to vision loss. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy is the less severe type of diabetic retinopathy and it is characterized by damage to the blood vessels in the retina. This damage can lead to the formation of microaneurysms, which are small bulges in the blood vessels. Microaneurysms can leak blood and fluid, which can lead to vision loss.

The symptoms of diabetic retinopathy can include:

Blurred vision
Floaters in the vision
Dark spots in the vision
Loss of vision

Diabetic retinopathy is treated with a variety of methods, including:

Laser surgery
Anti-VEGF injections
Vitrectomy surgery

Laser surgery is used to destroy the new blood vessels that grow in the retina. Anti-VEGF injections are used to block the growth of new blood vessels. Vitrectomy surgery is used to remove the blood and fluid from the retina.

Diabetic retinopathy is a serious complication of diabetes, but it can be treated if it is caught early. If you have diabetes, it is important to have regular eye exams to check for diabetic retinopathy.
