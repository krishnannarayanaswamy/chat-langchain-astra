Initial treatment for acute COPD exacerbation depends on the severity of the exacerbation. For patients with mild to moderate exacerbations, the initial treatment is a short-acting bronchodilator, such as albuterol. For patients with moderate to severe exacerbations, the initial treatment is a combination of a short-acting bronchodilator and a systemic corticosteroid. For patients with very severe exacerbations, the initial treatment is a combination of a short-acting bronchodilator, a systemic corticosteroid, and antibiotics.

In addition to the initial treatment, patients with acute COPD exacerbation may also require other treatments, such as oxygen therapy, chest physiotherapy, and pulmonary rehabilitation.
