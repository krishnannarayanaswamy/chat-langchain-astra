 The image is about Keratoacanthoma. It starts with a growing phase, then a maturation phase, and finally a resolution phase.

In the growing phase, a papule or nodule appears on the skin. It is usually firm and round, and it may be red or skin-colored. The nodule may grow slowly or quickly, and it may reach a size of 1-2 centimeters.

In the maturation phase, the nodule develops a central keratin plug. The plug is made up of dead skin cells, and it is often white or yellow in color. The plug may be surrounded by a red or inflamed area.

In the resolution phase, the plug falls off and the lesion disappears. The skin may be left with a scar.

Keratoacanthoma is a common skin condition. It is most often found on the face, hands, and arms. It is more common in adults than in children.

The cause of keratoacanthoma is unknown. Some doctors believe that it is caused by a virus. Others believe that it is caused by sun exposure.

Keratoacanthoma is usually treated with surgery. The nodule is removed with a scalpel or a laser. In some cases, the nodule may be treated with cryotherapy or radiation therapy.

Keratoacanthoma is a benign condition. It does not usually spread to other parts of the body. However, it can be locally aggressive, and it may invade the surrounding skin and tissue.

In rare cases, keratoacanthoma can develop into squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer.
