 The image is a table and diagram of the heart. The table has three columns: Function, Size, and Location. The first column lists the functions of the heart, which is to maintain circulation. The second column lists the size of the heart, which is approximately fist-sized. The third column lists the location of the heart, which is in the mediastinum.
The diagram shows the heart in more detail. The heart is divided into four chambers: the right atrium, the right ventricle, the left atrium, and the left ventricle. The right atrium receives blood from the body and pumps it to the right ventricle. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs. The left atrium receives blood from the lungs and pumps it to the left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps blood to the body.
The heart is a vital organ that pumps blood throughout the body. It is important to keep the heart healthy by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and not smoking.
