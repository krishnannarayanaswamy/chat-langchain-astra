 The image is about clinical features of Psoriasis.
Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by red, scaly patches of skin that can appear anywhere on the body. The most common type of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis, which appears as raised, red, scaly patches on the skin. Other types of psoriasis include guttate psoriasis, which appears as small, red dots on the skin; inverse psoriasis, which appears as smooth, red patches in the folds of the skin; and pustular psoriasis, which appears as small, white pustules on the skin.
The exact cause of psoriasis is unknown, but it is thought to be related to the immune system. Psoriasis is not contagious.
