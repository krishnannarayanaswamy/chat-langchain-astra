 ## Diabetic Retinopathy
According to WHO diabetic retinopathy is the world's leading cause of blindness.
40% diabetics develop DR.
More common in type 1 DM.

**Risk factors**
- Most important risk factor
 - Duration 
 - Poor control of blood glucose level
- Hypertension
- Nephropathy
- Pregnancy
- Hyperlipidemia
- Smoking

**Clinical symptoms**
- Blurred vision
- Floaters/colour vision
- Impaired vision
- Redness

**Screening guidelines**
- In type 1 diabetics: Examine after 5 years
- Subsequently annual exam once every year
- Gestational diabetes screening is required at the end of first trimester

**Pathophysiology**
- Occlusion and neovascularization
- Hyperglycemia
- Basement membrane thickening, platelet aggregation, leukocyte adherence
- Thrombus formation
- Retinal hypoxia
- VEGF formed
- Neovascularization

**2. Pericyte necrosis**
- Pericytes located in blood vessel wall
- Functions of pericytes
 - Regulation of blood flow
 - Stabilization of endothelial cells
- Normal pericyte to endothelial cell ratio is 1:1
- In diabetics this ratio is 1:4
 - Due to pericyte wall weaken
 - Leads to ballooning out
 - Leakage

**Pericyte loss**
Increase in blood sugar levels
- Normal Endothelial cell ratio 1:1
- Pericyte loss
- Oxidative stress
- Diabetes Conditions
Pericyte-Endothelial cell ratio 1:4
- Increased permeability
- Pericyte death
- Hypoxia
- VEGF
- Inflammation
- Immune cell infiltration

**Proliferative Retinopathy**
- Endothelial Cell
- Pericyte
