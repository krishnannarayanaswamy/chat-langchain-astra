 The image is a table that summarizes the diagnosis and management of cystic fibrosis. 

The first part of the image describes the diagnostic tests for cystic fibrosis. The newborn screening test is done to detect high levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) in newborns. The sweat test measures the chloride concentration in sweat to confirm the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing identifies specific CFTR gene mutations and helps in deciding treatment options. The nasal potential difference test evaluates the function of the CFTR protein in nasal epithelial cells.

The second part of the image describes the management of cystic fibrosis. Airway clearance techniques help to improve lung function by facilitating mucus removal from the airways. Bronchodilators relax airway smooth muscles and make it easier to breathe. Inhaled hypertonic saline increases airway hydration and facilitates mucus clearance. Inhaled mucolytic breaks down thick mucus and improves lung function. Pancreatic enzyme supplements aid digestion and nutrient absorption. Vitamins are necessary for individuals with cystic fibrosis to ensure adequate intake of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). CFTR modulator therapies improve lung function by enhancing CFTR protein processing, trafficking, and function at the cell surface. Antibiotics prophylaxis helps to prevent or reduce the frequency of respiratory infections. Lung transplant is considered for individuals with end-stage lung disease.
