The image contains two tables. 
**Table 11.1** lists the different types of porphyria, the enzyme defect that causes each type, and the characteristic symptoms. 
**Table 11.2** provides more information about acute intermittent porphyria, including the pattern of inheritance, enzyme deficiency, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment.

**Concepts:**

- Porphyria is a group of disorders that affect the production of heme, a component of hemoglobin.
- Heme is produced in the liver and bone marrow. 
- In porphyria, there is a deficiency of one of the enzymes involved in the heme production pathway. 
- This leads to a buildup of porphyrins, which are intermediates in the heme production pathway. 
- Porphyrins can accumulate in the skin, liver, and nervous system, causing a variety of symptoms. 
- The symptoms of porphyria can vary depending on the type of porphyria and the severity of the deficiency. 
- Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is the most common type of porphyria. 
- AIP is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase. 
- AIP is characterized by attacks of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. 
- Attacks can be triggered by a variety of factors, including stress, infection, and certain medications. 
- The diagnosis of porphyria is based on the patient's symptoms and a blood or urine test to measure porphyrin levels. 
- Treatment for porphyria is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing attacks. 
- Treatment may include pain medication, intravenous fluids, and blood transfusions. 
- In some cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

**Summary of Table 11.1:**

| Type of porphyria | Enzyme defect | Characteristic |
|---|---|---|
| Acute intermittent porphyria | Uroporphyrinogen I synthase | Abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms |
| Porphyria cutanea tarda | Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase | Photosensitivity |
| Hereditary coproporphyria | Coproporphyrinogen oxidase | Abdominal pain, Photosensitivity, neuropsychiatric symptoms |
| Variegate porphyria | Protoporphyrinogen oxidase | Abdominal pain, photosensitivity, neuropsychiatric symptoms |
| Congenital erythropoietic porphyria | Uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase | Photosensitivity increased hemolysis |
| Protoporphyria | Ferrochelatase | Photosensitivity |

**Summary of Table 11.2:**

| Pattern of inheritance | Enzyme deficiency | Substrate accumulated | Clinical features | Diagnosis | Treatment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Autosomal dominant | Porphobilinogen deaminase/Hydroxymethylbilane synthase | Porphobilinogen (PBG) and aminolevulinic acid (ALA) | Acute neurovisceral attacks: abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, psychiatric symptoms, port-wine urine | Urine test for elevated levels of PBG and ALA during an attack; genetic testing for gene mutations | High carbohydrate diet; intravenous glucose or hemin during acute attacks; avoidance of triggering factors (e.g., barbiturates, oral contraceptives) |
