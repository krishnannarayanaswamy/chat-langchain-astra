 The image is a flowchart that shows the relationship between neurotransmitter deficiency, neural network abnormality, phenotype, endophenotype, and behavioral treatment of ADHD. 

The neurotransmitter dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, histamine, glutamate, and nicotine-acetylcholine are involved in the pathophysiology of ADHD. 

The neural network abnormality can be caused by a deficiency in one or more of these neurotransmitters. 

The phenotype of ADHD is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. 

The endophenotype of ADHD is characterized by executive function, abnormal EEG, and neuroimaging. 

The behavioral treatment of ADHD includes cognitive training, physical exercise, and neurofeedback therapy.
