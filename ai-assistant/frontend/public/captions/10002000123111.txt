 The image is a flowchart that shows the diagnostic and treatment algorithm for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). It is based on the Wells score, which is a clinical prediction rule that can be used to estimate the probability of DVT in a patient with suspected symptoms. 

The flowchart is divided into three sections: low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk. The low risk section is for patients with a Wells score of 0-1 points. These patients are unlikely to have DVT and can be discharged without further testing. The intermediate risk section is for patients with a Wells score of 2-6 points. These patients should have a D-dimer test. If the D-dimer test is negative, the patient can be discharged without further testing. If the D-dimer test is positive, the patient should have a compression ultrasound of the legs. If the compression ultrasound is negative, the patient can be discharged without further treatment. If the compression ultrasound is positive, the patient should be treated for DVT. The high risk section is for patients with a Wells score of 7 or more points. These patients should be treated for DVT without further testing. 

The flowchart also includes information on the treatment of DVT. The treatment of DVT typically involves anticoagulant medication, which can help to prevent the blood from clotting. The type of anticoagulant medication that is used will depend on the patient's individual情况.
