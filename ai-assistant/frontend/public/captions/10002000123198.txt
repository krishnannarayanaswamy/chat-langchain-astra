 The image is a table that shows the prevalence and composition of common renal stones. The table is divided into seven columns. The first column lists the type of stone, the second column lists the prevalence of the stone, the third column lists the risk factors for the stone, and the fourth column lists the contributing factors for the stone. The fifth column lists the symptoms of the stone, the sixth column lists the treatment for the stone, and the seventh column lists the prevention for the stone.

The most common type of stone is calcium oxalate, which accounts for 36-70% of all renal stones. The risk factors for calcium oxalate stones include hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, gouty diathesis, and low urine volume. The contributing factors for calcium oxalate stones include distal renal tubular acidosis and hyperparathyroidism. The symptoms of calcium oxalate stones include flank pain, hematuria, and nausea. The treatment for calcium oxalate stones includes hydration, pain relievers, and medical therapy. The prevention of calcium oxalate stones includes drinking plenty of fluids, eating a low-oxalate diet, and taking calcium supplements.

The second most common type of stone is calcium phosphate, which accounts for 6-20% of all renal stones. The risk factors for calcium phosphate stones include hypercalcemia, hyperphosphaturia, and low urine volume. The contributing factors for calcium phosphate stones include distal renal tubular acidosis and hyperparathyroidism. The symptoms of calcium phosphate stones include flank pain, hematuria, and nausea. The treatment for calcium phosphate stones includes hydration, pain relievers, and medical therapy. The prevention of calcium phosphate stones includes drinking plenty of fluids, eating a low-phosphate diet, and taking calcium supplements.

The third most common type of stone is mixed calcium oxalate and phosphate, which accounts for 11-31% of all renal stones. The risk factors for mixed calcium oxalate and phosphate stones include hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, gouty diathesis, and low urine volume. The contributing factors for mixed calcium oxalate and phosphate stones include distal renal tubular acidosis and hyperparathyroidism. The symptoms of mixed calcium oxalate and phosphate stones include flank pain, hematuria, and nausea. The treatment for mixed calcium oxalate and phosphate stones includes hydration, pain relievers, and medical therapy. The prevention of mixed calcium oxalate and phosphate stones includes drinking plenty of fluids, eating a low-oxalate and low-phosphate diet, and taking calcium supplements.

The fourth most common type of stone is struvite, which accounts for 6-20% of all renal stones. The risk factors for struvite stones include urinary tract infections, urea-splitting organisms, and low urine volume. The contributing factors for struvite stones include distal renal tubular acidosis and hyperparathyroidism. The symptoms of struvite stones include flank pain, hematuria, and nausea. The treatment for struvite stones includes hydration, pain relievers, and antibiotics. The prevention of struvite stones includes drinking plenty of fluids, avoiding urinary tract infections, and taking antibiotics.

The fifth most common type of stone is uric acid, which accounts for 17% of all renal stones. The risk factors for uric acid stones include gouty diathesis, arthritis, nephropathy, hyperuricosuria, hyperuricemia, low urine volume, and urinary pH <6. The contributing factors for uric acid stones include obesity, myeloproliferative disorders, and alcohol abuse. The symptoms of uric acid stones include flank pain, hematuria, and nausea. The treatment for uric acid stones includes hydration, pain relievers, and medical therapy. The prevention of uric acid stones includes drinking plenty of fluids, eating a low-purine diet, and taking allopurinol.

The sixth most common type of stone is cystine, which accounts for 0.5-3% of all renal stones. The risk factors for cystine stones include cystinuria, congenital intestinal tract defect, and congenital renal transport error. The contributing factors for cystine stones include low urine volume and high urinary pH. The symptoms of cystine stones include flank pain, hematuria, and nausea. The treatment for cystine stones includes hydration, pain relievers, and medical therapy. The prevention of cystine stones includes drinking plenty of fluids, eating a low-cystine diet, and taking medications to increase urine volume and lower urinary pH.

The seventh and final type of stone is other, which accounts for 1-4% of all renal stones. The risk factors for other stones include the use of specific medications, such as indinavir, ephedrine, and triamterene. The contributing factors for other stones include underlying medical conditions, such as renal tubular acidosis and hyperparathyroidism. The symptoms of other stones include flank pain, hematuria, and nausea. The treatment for other stones includes hydration, pain relievers, and medical therapy. The prevention of other stones includes drinking plenty of fluids, avoiding the use of specific medications, and managing underlying medical conditions.
