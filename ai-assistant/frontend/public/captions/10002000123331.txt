 97 PSORIASIS

Psoriasis
• Chronic disorder
• Relapsing remitting course
• Immune mediated
Etiology (Multifactorial)
Systemic Chronic Inflammation
• Immune Factors
Environmental Factors
Heredity
HLA-Cw6
PSORS 1
• Factors which lead to systemic chronic inflammation are
• Genetic factors (Heredity)
o Immune factors
o Environmental factors
Genetic Factors
HLA Cw6 Early onset disease, positive family history
HLA B27 Psoriatic arthritis, nail changes
PSOR1
Environmental factors
• Infection
• Streptococcal throat infection which develops Guttate psoriasis
• HIV positive aggravates psoriasis
Medication (BATNAILS)
o Beta blockers
O ACE inhibitors
○ TNA alpha inhibitors
O NSAIDs
o Antimalarials
○ IFN (Interferon) gamma
o Lithium
o Steroids
Psoriasis aggravated by:
• o Alcohol
o Cigarette smoking
O Stress
o Sunlight is protective, but in 20% cases it may aggravate psoriasis
O Trauma
• Reduced epidermal turnover time to 4 days (normal 56 days)
Ο This leads to hyperproliferation of keratinocytes
• Angiogenesis / vasodilation-Increased blood flow
• Inflammation- TH-1 type of response is generated, no TH-2 response
• TH-1 has
• o TNF-y
o TNF-a
○ TH-17 (IL-17)
○ TH-22 (IL-22)
Inflammation causes vasodilation and targets hyperproliferation in keratinocytes.
Histopathology
• Dermal changes precede epidermal changes
Stratum corneum
o Hyperkeratosis (Thickening of corneum)
o Parakeratosis (Retention of nuclei in Stratum corneum)
o Munro's microbscess (Formation of micro abscess- collection of neutrophils)
Stratum Granulosum
o Agranulocytosis/Agranulosis (Absent granular layer)
Malpighian layer (Stratum Spinosum and Basale)
o Acanthosis (Increased thickness) or Stratum Spinosum
o Kogoj's Spongiform pustules (Collection of neutrophils)
Important Information
Rete ridges are the invaginations of epidermis into dermis.
In psoriasis, rete ridges are elongated, and club shaped (Camel foot appearance)
Dermis
o Suprapapillary thinning
o Dilated tortuous blood vessels
o Inflammation
Important Information
• Hyperkeratosis
• Parakeratosis is a giveaway in psoriasis
• Thickening of Stratum corneum, with many nuclei
• Rete ridges are club shaped, elongated and appear like camel foot
• No granular layer
• Stratum Spinosum is thick, Acanthosis
• Suprapapillary thinning
• Presence of inflammation and vasodilation
