 Title: Clinical Assessment

- History: A good history can reveal the etiologic diagnosis in up to 85% of cases of amenorrhea.
- Ask about:
 - Menstrual cycle: age of menarche and previous menstrual history
 - Previous pregnancies - severe PPH (Sheehan Syndrome)
 - Weight change: A large amount of weight loss (anorexia nervosa)
 - Hot flashes, decreased libido: premature menopause
 - Certain medications
 - Contraception
 - Associate symptoms - Cushing's disease, hypothyroidism
 - Previous gynaecological surgery
 - Chronic illness
- Check for:
 - Body Mass Index (BMI): weight loss-related amenorrhea
 - Blood Pressure: elevated in Cushing and PCOS
- Androgen excess: hirsutism (PCOS), virilization (tumor)
- Secondary sexual characteristics
- Features of Turner Syndrome
- Breast examination: may reveal galactorrhea
- Abdominal (haematoma) and pelvic masses (ovarian tumor)
- Inspection of genitalia: imperforate hymen, cervical stenosis
- Vaginal examination: blind vagina, vaginal atresia, absence of Uterus

Differential Diagnoses

| Site of Disorder | Diagnosis | Investigations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Hypothalamus | Hypothalamic-pituitary failure | FSH, LH and estradiol - Low |
| Pituitary | Weight-related amenorrhea | Prolactin – High FSH, LH and estradiol - Low |
|  | Sheehan syndrome | FSH, LH and estrogen - Low |
| Endocrine | Hypothyroidism | TSH - raised; T4 – low or N |
| Ovary | Premature menopause | FSH, LH - high; E₂ Low |
|  | PCOS | FSH - Normal; LH High |
| Mullerian Tract | Asherman's syndrome | PCT - Negative HSG/ Hysteroscopy |

Diagnosis & Investigations
- Once pregnancy has been excluded,
 - Progesterone challenge test
 - TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone)
 - FSH, LH
 - Prolactin level

Approach to secondary amenorrhea
Refer Flow Chart 57.1

Treatment
- Cyclic progesterone
- GnRH: when the cause is hypothalamic failure
- Thyroid hormone replacement
- Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Reverse inciting factor
- Hypothyroidism: Treat with synthetic thyroid hormone
- Hyperprolactinemia
 - MRI/CT head to rule out lesion → surgery if a lesion
 - If no lesion - bromocriptine, and cabergoline if fertility desired; combined OCP if no fertility
- Sheehan syndrome: Treat like primary deficiencies of respective target glands due to hypopituitarism
- Premature Ovarian Failure
 - Hormonal therapy - estrogen + progestin
- Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
 - Weight loss, OCP, ovulation induction (clomiphene citrate) if fertility desired
- Asherman's Syndrome: Surgical hysteroscopy to lyse adhesions
