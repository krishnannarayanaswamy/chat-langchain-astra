 The image is a table that summarizes the clinical presentation, management, and investigations for prolactinomas in males.

**Clinical presentation**

- Erectile dysfunction
- Infertility
- Low levels of testosterone which leads to decreased libido
- Galactorrhea
- Enlarged breast tissue (gynecomastia)

**Additional information**

- The signs and symptoms of prolactinomas can vary depending upon the following factors:
 - How much excess prolactin is produced by the pituitary gland
 - Size of the prolactinoma
 - Location
- Male individuals and women who have reached menopause may not have any overt signs and symptoms.
- Thus, diagnosis is delayed among these groups.

**Management**
- Treatment options for prolactinomas
 - Pharmacotherapy (It is the preferred method of initial management)
 - Surgery
 - Radiation therapy

**Medications**

- Dopamine agonists: Control prolactin levels by shrinking the prolactinoma tumors.
- The most commonly used dopamine agonists are:
 - Cabergoline
 - Bromocriptine
- Cabergoline is the first-choice medication for treating prolactinomas. It has fewer side effects when compared to bromocriptine.
- Side effects of dopamine agonists include:
 - Nausea
 - Vomiting
 - Dizziness
- Relapse can be avoided only if the medications are continued for at least a period of 2 years.

**Surgery**

- Surgery is done in case of the following conditions:
 - If you have side effects to medications that are prescribed to treat prolactinomas.
 - If you are taking antipsychotic medication which interact with the medications taken for prolactinoma treatment.
 - If the medications are not working and fail to reduce the size of the tumor.
 - If the prolactinoma is large in size and you are trying to get pregnant in the recent future.
- Two types of surgeries are carried out to treat prolactinoma:
 - Transsphenoidal surgery: Is the most common surgery to treat prolactinomas and is performed through an incision made at the back of the nasal cavity or under the upper lip.
 - Transcranial surgery: Is done when the size of the prolactinoma is large and has spread to other areas. The surgery is performed by opening the skull.
- Risks associated with surgical removal of prolactinomas:
 - Impaired pituitary function (hypopituitarism)
 - Temporary diabetes insipidus
 - Cerebrospinal fluid leak
 - Infection
