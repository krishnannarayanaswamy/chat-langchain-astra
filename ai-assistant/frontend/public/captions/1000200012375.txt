 **Asthma: Clinical Findings**
- Variable, sporadic airway obstruction in response to certain triggers (see also slide on pathogenesis)
>If severe:
-Ventilation of alveoli ↓
-blood hypoxemia
-Heart rate ↑
-Respiratory rate ↑
-Tidal volume ↓
-Use of accessory muscles to breathe
-tachypnea
-tachycardia

During expiration, positive pleural pressure squeezes airways → ↑ airway obstruction
-Patients need to voluntarily contract their expiratory muscles forcefully → more effective chest emptying
- ↑airway resistance (high-pitched expiratory sound)

Chest tightness (shortness of breath)

During severe attacks, patients may recruit accessory thoracic muscles by activating compensatory mechanisms:
- ↑airway obstruction
-↑ intrathoracic pressure on expiration, lungs take longer to empty
-prolonged expiratory phase of breathing

Note:
- Symptoms often worse in the morning
-Wheezing should be differentiated from other causes of upper respiratory tract infections or COPD.

Associated allergic eosinophilic infiltrate:
-Eyes: red, watery eyes
-Conjunctivitis
-Nose: rhinitis, sneezing, etc.
-Skin: atopic dermatitis
-Eosinophilic infiltrate
