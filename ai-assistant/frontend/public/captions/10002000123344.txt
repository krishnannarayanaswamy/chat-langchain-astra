 The image is a table that summarizes the diagnosis and treatment of vaginal yeast infection. The table lists the following information:

KOH smear: This test looks for the presence of yeast cells, hyphae, and budding yeast cells in a sample of vaginal discharge.
Wet mount: This test looks for the presence of motile, pear-shaped bodies in a sample of vaginal discharge.
Gram stain: This test looks for the presence of clue cells, which are vaginal epithelial cells that are covered in bacteria.
Clue cells are a sign of bacterial vaginosis, which is a common cause of vaginal itching and irritation.
Treatment: The treatment for vaginal yeast infection is typically an azole antifungal medication, such as fluconazole or itraconazole. These medications can be taken orally or applied topically to the vagina.
In some cases, a combination of medications may be needed to treat the infection.
If the infection is severe or does not respond to treatment, a healthcare provider may recommend additional tests to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms.
