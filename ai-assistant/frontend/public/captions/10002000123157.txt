 ## **Lipid Metabolism Disorders**
Lipids within the body are ingested as food or synthesized by adipocytes or hepatocytes from carbohydrate precursors.
It is associated with carbohydrate metabolism as products of glucose (such as acetyl CoA) can be converted into lipids.
Just like glucose, the end products of fatty acid metabolism are carbon dioxide, water, and ATP.
However, the complete metabolism of fatty acids to these products also requires glucose; otherwise, ketones are produced.
Dietary lipids are 90% triacylglycerols.
Other dietary lipids include cholesterol esters, phospholipids, essential unsaturated fatty acids, and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).
Fat is energy-rich and provides 9 kcal/gm.

## **Lipid Transport, Storage, and Utilization**
Normally, essentially all (98%) of the fat consumed is absorbed and transported to adipose tissue for storage.
Dietary lipid: Triacylglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids
Dietary lipid transport: Chylomicron
Endogenous lipid transport: VLDL, IDL, LDL, HDL

## **Lipoproteins**
Lipoproteins are the macromolecular complex of lipids and proteins.

**Structure of lipoproteins**
Hydrophobic lipids (TG, CE) in the core;
Hydrophilic lipids (UC, PL) on the surface

## **Primary Disorders of Elevated ApoB Containing Lipoproteins**
### **Lipid Disorders Associated with Elevated LDL-C and Normal Triglycerides**
1. Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH)
2. Familial Defective ApoB-100 (FDB)
3. Autosomal Dominant Hypercholesterolemia Due to Mutations in PCSK9 (ADH-PCSK9 or ADH3)
4. Autosomal Recessive Hypercholesterolemia (ARH)
5. Polygenic Hypercholesterolemia

### **Lipid Disorders Associated with Elevated Triglycerides**
1. Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome
2. Apo A-V Deficiency
3. GPIHBP1 Deficiency
4. Familial Hypertriglyceridemia (FHTG)
5. Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia (FCHL)
6. Hepatic Lipase Deficiency
7. Familial Dysbetalipoproteinemia

## **Genetic Disorders of HDL Metabolism**
### **Inherited Causes of Low Levels of HDL-C**
1. Gene deletions in the Apoav-AI-CIII-AIV locus and coding mutations in ApoA-I
2. Tangier Disease (ABCA1 Deficiency)
3. LCAT Deficiency
4. Primary Hypoalphalipoproteinemia

### **Inherited Causes of High Levels of HDL-C**
1. CETP Deficiency
2. Familial Hyperalphalipoproteinemia AUD

## **Familial Dyslipidemias**

## **Abetalipoproteinemia**
Genetic cause: Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the MTP gene, which encodes for microsomal triglyceride transfer protein.
