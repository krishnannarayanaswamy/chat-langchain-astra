 The image is a flowchart that shows the pathogenesis and complications of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

DVT is a condition in which a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the leg. 

There are many risk factors for DVT, including:
- Malignancy
- Trauma/surgery
- Hypercoagulable state
- Inherited disorders
- Pregnancy
- Oral contraceptives
- Obesity
- Hypertension
- Diabetes
- Smoking
- Prolonged immobilization

The symptoms of DVT can include:
- Pain in the leg
- Swelling in the leg
- Warmth in the leg
- Redness in the leg
- Tenderness in the leg

If you have any of these symptoms, it is important to see a doctor right away. DVT can be a serious condition, and it can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism.

A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that travels to the lungs. It can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, and coughing. Pulmonary emboli can be fatal.

Treatment for DVT typically involves taking blood thinners. Blood thinners help to prevent the blood from clotting. They can also help to dissolve existing blood clots.

In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove a blood clot.

Preventing DVT is important. There are a number of things you can do to help prevent DVT, including:
- Getting regular exercise
- Maintaining a healthy weight
- Avoiding smoking
- Limiting alcohol intake
- Avoiding prolonged sitting or standing
- Wearing compression stockings if you are at high risk for DVT

If you have any risk factors for DVT, it is important to talk to your doctor about ways to prevent it.
