 The image is about tuberculosis (TB), a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is spread through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. TB can affect any organ in the body, but most commonly affects the lungs.

The image contains a flowchart that summarizes the classification of drug-resistant TB. Drug-resistant TB is caused by organisms that are resistant to one or more of the drugs used to treat TB. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most effective drugs used to treat TB. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) is resistant to MDR TB plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs.

The image also contains a table that summarizes the sites of TB disease. TB can occur in the lungs (pulmonary TB) or in other parts of the body (extrapulmonary TB). Extrapulmonary TB is most commonly found in the lymph nodes, bones and joints, and genitourinary system.

Finally, the image contains a set of guidelines on how to prevent the spread of TB. These guidelines include:

* Isolating infected persons
* Providing effective treatment to infectious persons as soon as possible
* Ensuring that people who are at risk of TB are vaccinated
* Improving living conditions and access to healthcare

TB is a serious disease, but it can be cured if it is diagnosed and treated early. If you think you might have TB, see your doctor right away.
