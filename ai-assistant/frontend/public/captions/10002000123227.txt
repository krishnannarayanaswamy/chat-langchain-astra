 Cardiac muscle
- Involuntary control: Found in the heart, responsible for
pumping blood.
- Striated appearance: Actin and myosin filaments arranged in
a regular pattern like skeletal muscles.
- Intercalated discs: Unique cell junctions that enable
synchronised contractions.
- Autorhythmicity: Capable of generating its own electrical
impulses, regulated by the heart's pacemaker cells.
- Limited regeneration capacity: Cardiac muscle cells have
limited ability to regenerate after injury.

Structure of Skeletal Muscle Fibre
Refer Diagram 60.1
Muscle fibres: Long, cylindrical, and multinucleated cells
that make up skeletal muscles. They contain numerous
myofibrils.
- Myofibrils: Thread-like structures within muscle fibres,
composed of repeating units called sarcomeres. They are
responsible for muscle contraction.
- Sarcomeres: The basic functional unit of a myofibril,
containing myofilaments (actin and myosin) responsible for
muscle contractions. They are marked by Z lines.
- Myofilaments: Protein filaments, including actin (thin
filaments) and myosin (thick filaments), that interact during
muscle contraction.
- A band: The dark, central region of a sarcomere containing
overlapping actin and myosin filaments.
- I band: The light region of a sarcomere, containing only actin
filaments, and located between adjacent Abands.
- Z line (Z disc): Thin, dark lines that bisect I bands and mark
the boundaries of sarcomeres. They anchor the actin
filaments.
- H zone: The central region of the A band in which there are no
overlapping actin filaments, only myosin filaments. During
muscle contraction, the H zone becomes shorter as the actin
filaments slide further into it.

Muscle contraction and relaxation
- The four actions necessary for muscle contraction and
relaxation.
1. Excitation - Action potentials in the nerve lead to the
formation of action potentials in a muscle fibre.
2. Excitation- Contraction Coupling - action potentials on the
sarcolemma activate myofilaments.
3. Contraction - Shortening of a muscle fibre or at least the
formation of tension.
4. Relaxation - The return of a muscle fibre to its resting length.

Neuromuscular junction and acetylcholine
- Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the synapse between
motor neurons and muscle fibres
- Motor neurons release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine
(ACh) into the synaptic cleft
- ACh binds to nicotinic receptors on the muscle cell
membrane, creating an action potential
- Action potential triggers the release of calcium ions from SR,
initiating muscle contraction
- Acetylcholinesterase enzyme breaks down ACh, terminating
the signal
Refer Diagram 60.2

The sliding filament theory
- Describes the mechanism of muscle contraction at a
molecular level
- Involves interactions between actin (thin) and myosin (thick)
protein filaments within sarcomeres
- Upon muscle activation, myosin heads attach to actin
filaments, forming cross-bridges
- Myosin heads pull actin filaments towards the sarcomere
centre in a "power stroke" motion
- Contraction continues as long as ATP is available and
calcium ions are present
- Sarcomere shortens, leading to overall muscle contraction
Refer Diagram 60.3

Adenosine provides energy for myosin head "power stroke"
during contraction
- ATP binds to myosin, allowing detachment from actin after
the power stroke
- ATP is hydrolysed, re-energising myosin head for the next
contraction cycle
- Sustained muscle contraction depends on continuous ATP
supply

Role of calcium ions and the sarcoplasmic reticulum
- Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a specialised endoplasmic
reticulum found in muscle cells
- Stores and releases calcium ions, which are crucial for
muscle contraction
- Upon muscle activation, SR releases calcium ions into the
sarcoplasm
- Calcium ions bind to troponin, causing a conformational
change in tropomyosin
- This change exposes myosin-binding sites on actin filaments,
allowing cross-bridge formation
- Muscle contraction stops when calcium ions are pumped
back into the SR
