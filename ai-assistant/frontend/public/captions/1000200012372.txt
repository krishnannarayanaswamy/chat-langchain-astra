 The image shows the process of breathing. On the left, we see the process of inspiration, and on the right, we see the process of expiration.

During inspiration, the thoracic cavity expands as the external intercostal muscles contract and the diaphragm contracts. This creates a negative pressure in the thoracic cavity, which causes air to flow into the lungs.

During expiration, the thoracic cavity reduces as the external intercostal muscles relax and the diaphragm relaxes. This creates a positive pressure in the thoracic cavity, which causes air to flow out of the lungs.

The process of breathing is essential for life. It allows us to take in oxygen from the air and expel carbon dioxide.
