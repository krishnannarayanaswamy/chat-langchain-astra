 **Title:** Lipid Metabolism Disorders

**Clinical features:**
Symptoms usually appear in infancy and include fat malabsorption, steatorrhea (fatty, foul-smelling stools), and failure to thrive. Patients may develop neurological complications, such as ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and retinitis pigmentosa.

**Diagnosis:**
- Blood tests reveal extremely low or absent levels of cholesterol, LDL, and apolipoprotein B.
- Abnormal lipid profile with acanthocytosis (spiky red blood cells) seen on the peripheral blood smear.
- Genetic testing to confirm the presence of MTP gene mutations.

**Management:**
- High-dose vitamin E supplementation to prevent or slow the progression of neurological complications.
- Fat-soluble vitamin supplementation (A, D, E, K) to address deficiencies.
- A low-fat diet with medium-chain triglyceride supplementation to improve fat absorption and nutrition.

**Treatment for Lipid metabolism disorders**
- Lifestyle changes:
 - Total fat intake almost 20-30% calories
 - Cholesterol level <200 mg/d
 - Quit smoking
 - Weight loss
 - Exercise
- Drugs:
 - Lowers cholesterol/LDL: statins, fenofibrate, ezetimibe
 - Lowers triglycerides: diet, fibrates, omega-3 fish oil

**Indications for Statin Use**
- Primary prevention for:
 - LDL-C>=190 mg/dl
- Diabetes and aged 40-75 years with LDL-C between 70-189 mg/dl
 - No diabetes and estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of≥ 7.5% who are between 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C between 70-189 mg/dl
- Secondary prevention for:
 - Patients with known coronary heart disease
 - Other cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease
 - Combinations of risk factors that result in 10-year risk of ASCVD events of more than 20 percent
 - Chronic kidney disease with estimated GFR <45ml/min/1.73m²

| Disorder | Inheritance | Clinical Features | Treatment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gaucher disease | Autosomal recessive | Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, bone pain, pathologic fractures | Enzyme replacement therapy |
| Niemann-Pick disease | Autosomal recessive | Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, neurologic deterioration, cherry-red spot in the macula | No specific treatment |
| Fabry disease | X-linked recessive | Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum, acroparesthesias, renal failure, cardiomyopathy | Enzyme replacement therapy |
| Tay-Sachs disease | Autosomal recessive | Progressive neurologic deterioration, blindness, seizures | No specific treatment |
| Sandhoff disease | Autosomal recessive | Similar to Tay-Sachs disease, but with onset in infancy | No specific treatment |

**Flowchart 44.1: Tangier Disease**

Autosomal codominant disorder due to mutations in both alleles of the ABC1 gene
- Extremely marked reduction in HDL-C and apoA-I
- Markedly accelerated catabolism of apoA-I
Cholesterol accumulation leads to:
- Enlarged orange tonsils
- Hepatosplenomegaly
- Peripheral neuropathy
