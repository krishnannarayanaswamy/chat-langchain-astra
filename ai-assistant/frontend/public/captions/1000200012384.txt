 ## **Lung cancer**
**Epidemiology**
- Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.
- It affects more than 1 million cases per year in India.
- The peak age is 65-75 years.
- More common in men except for adenocarcinoma.

**Types and Etiology**
- Tobacco smoking is associated with 80%-90% of lung carcinoma; however, it is weakly associated with lung adenocarcinoma.
- Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer.
- Asbestos
- Occupational exposure to chromium, silica, nickel, arsenic and beryllium.
- Pulmonary fibrosis and scarring, radiation exposure, tuberculosis and HIV are other risk factors.

**Refer Flow Chart 25.1**

There are two main types of lung cancer: small cell carcinoma and non-small cell carcinoma:

**SCLC**
- 10-15% of lung cancers
- Classically, 3 subtypes
- Usually centrally located
- More aggressive
- Staged as limited or extensive disease
- Treatment usually involves chemotherapy with or without radiation

**NSCLC**
- 85-90% of lung cancers
- Many subtypes
- Centrally or peripherally located
- Can be fast or slow growing
- Staged using TNM staging
- Treatment is surgical, medical or radiation

**Small cell lung carcinoma**
- It is a centrally located tumour strongly associated with smoking.
- It is an undifferentiated and highly aggressive tumour.
- Neuroendocrine Kulchitsky cells are present, and the tumour is synaptophysin, chromogranin A and neuron-specific enolase positive.
- SIADH, Cushing syndrome, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, and limbic encephalitis are paraneoplastic syndromes.

**Bronchial carcinoid tumour**
- It is the most common primary lung cancer in children and adults.
- It presents wheezing due to the mass effect of the tumour.
- Neuroendocrine Kulchitsky cells are present, and the tumour is synaptophysin, chromogranin A and neuron-specific enolase positive.
- It rarely metastasises and has a good prognosis.

**Staging of Lung Cancer**
**Refer Table 25.2**

**Diagnosis and Clinical Features**
**Refer Flow Chart 25.2**

**Diagnosis**
- Chest X-ray is the first line of imaging.
- CT chest is done in all patients with abnormal chest X-rays.
- Diagnosis is confirmed by histology by taking a central bronchoscopy, ultrasound, or CT-guided needle biopsy.
- A complete blood count and a metabolic panel should be ordered to assess paraneoplastic syndromes.
- CT chest and abdomen should be performed to assess the metastasis.
