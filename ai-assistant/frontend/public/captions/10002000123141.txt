 The image is a table that lists the risk factors for type 1 diabetes. The risk factors are grouped into the following categories: viral infections, race/ethnicity, geography, family history, diet, and other autoimmune conditions.

Viral infections that can trigger type 1 diabetes include German measles, Coxsackie, Mumps, Rubella (in utero), Retroviruses, Cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus.

Certain ethnicities have a higher rate of type 1 diabetes. In the US, Caucasians are more susceptible to type diabetes than African and Hispanic Americans. Chinese people seem at a lower risk of developing type 1 diabetes.

People living in the northern climate are mostly at higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes. In contrast, people in southern climates, such as South America, are less likely to develop type 1 diabetes.

Individuals with a family history have higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes. Studies show that the child of a father with type 1 diabetes is at higher risk than a child of a mother with type 1 diabetes. According to certain studies, children who are given cow's milk (containing bovine serum albumin) are at higher risk.

Dietary nitrosamines (in smoked and cured meats) and Coffee are also risk factors.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. Autoimmune conditions that increase the risk of type 1 diabetes include: Graves' disease, Multiple sclerosis, Pernicious anaemia, Coeliac disease, Vitiligo, and Addison's disease.
