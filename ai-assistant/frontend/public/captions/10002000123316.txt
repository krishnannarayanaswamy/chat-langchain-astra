Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a type of skin inflammation that occurs when the skin comes into contact with an allergen. Allergens are substances that can trigger an allergic reaction. In the case of ACD, the allergen is usually a chemical that is found in products such as jewelry, cosmetics, and clothing.

ACD can cause a variety of symptoms, including redness, itching, swelling, and blisters. In some cases, ACD can also cause more severe symptoms, such as scarring and infection.

Treatment for ACD typically involves avoiding the allergen that is causing the reaction. In some cases, medications such as corticosteroids or antihistamines may be necessary to relieve symptoms.

Prevention is the best way to avoid ACD. This means avoiding contact with known allergens and being careful when using new products. If you experience any symptoms of ACD, it is important to see a doctor to get a diagnosis and treatment.
