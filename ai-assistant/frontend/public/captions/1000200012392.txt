 The image is about the cardiac cycle. It shows the different phases of the cardiac cycle, the electrical conduction pathway, and the heart sounds.
    The cardiac cycle is the sequence of events that occur during one heartbeat. It is divided into two phases: systole and diastole.
Systole is the contraction of the heart muscle, and diastole is the relaxation of the heart muscle.
The electrical conduction pathway is the route that the electrical impulse takes from the sinoatrial node (SA node) to the ventricles. The SA node is the natural pacemaker of the heart, and it generates the electrical impulse that triggers the heart to contract. The electrical impulse travels from the SA node to the atrioventricular node (AV node), which delays the impulse slightly. The impulse then travels down the bundle of His, which divides into the left and right bundle branches. The bundle branches carry the impulse to the ventricles, which contract in response.
The heart sounds are the sounds that are produced by the heart as it contracts and relaxes. The first heart sound is the "lub" sound, which is caused by the closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves. The second heart sound is the "dub" sound, which is caused by the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves.
The image also shows the Frank-Starling mechanism, which is a relationship between the end-diastolic volume of the heart and the stroke volume. The end-diastolic volume is the amount of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole. The stroke volume is the amount of blood that is ejected from the ventricles during systole. The Frank-Starling mechanism states that the stroke volume is directly proportional to the end-diastolic volume. This means that the more blood that is in the ventricles at the end of diastole, the more blood will be ejected during systole.
