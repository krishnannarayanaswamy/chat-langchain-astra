 The image is about the digestive system. It includes the tongue, epiglottis, pharynx, esophagus, and stomach.

The tongue is a fleshy and muscular sensory organ that helps in tasting and swallowing. It is attached to the floor of the mouth by a ligamentous band called the frenulum. The tongue has two sets of muscles: four intrinsic muscles and four extrinsic muscles. The intrinsic muscles originate in the tongue and are involved with its shaping, while the extrinsic muscles originate in bone and are involved with its movement.

The epiglottis is a flap of elastic cartilage attached to the entrance of the larynx. It has a mucosal coverage and there are taste buds on its lingual surface which faces into the mouth. The epiglottis functions to guard the entrance of the glottis. It is normally pointed upward during breathing with its underside functioning as part of the pharynx. The epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position, with its upper side functioning as part of the pharynx, during swallowing. This prevents the food from going into the trachea.

The pharynx is a part of both the respiratory system and the digestive system. It is situated above the esophagus and larynx, behind the nasal cavity. The pharynx is made up of three parts. The lower two parts—the oropharynx and the laryngopharynx—are involved in the digestive system.

The esophagus is a muscular tube that carries food from the pharynx to the stomach. It passes through the posterior mediastinum in the thorax and enters the stomach through a hole in the thoracic diaphragm. The esophagus is lined with mucous membrane and has two sphincters: the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter. The upper esophageal sphincter prevents food from entering the trachea, while the lower esophageal sphincter prevents food from regurgitating back into the esophagus.

The stomach is a J-shaped organ that is located in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. It is the largest organ in the digestive system. The stomach secretes gastric juices, which help to break down food. The stomach also churns the food, which helps to mix it with the gastric juices. The stomach is lined with a thick layer of mucous membrane, which helps to protect it from the acidic gastric juices.
