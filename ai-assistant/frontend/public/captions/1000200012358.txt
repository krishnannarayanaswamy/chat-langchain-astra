 The image is a flowchart that describes the treatment of diverticulitis. 

The treatment of diverticulitis depends on the severity of the condition. In mild cases, treatment may involve antibiotics, pain relievers, and a low-fiber diet. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary.

**Uncomplicated diverticulitis**
In uncomplicated diverticulitis, the inflammation is limited to the diverticula. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel habits. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, pain relievers, and a low-fiber diet.

**Complicated diverticulitis**
In complicated diverticulitis, the inflammation has spread to the surrounding tissues or organs. This can lead to more serious complications, such as perforation of the colon, abscess formation, and sepsis. Treatment typically involves surgery to remove the affected portion of the colon.

**Treatment**
The treatment of diverticulitis depends on the severity of the condition. In mild cases, treatment may involve:
- Antibiotics to kill the bacteria that are causing the infection
- Pain relievers to relieve abdominal pain
- A low-fiber diet to rest the colon and allow it to heal

In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected portion of the colon. Surgery may also be necessary if the diverticulitis has caused complications, such as perforation of the colon or abscess formation.

**Prevention**
There are no surefire ways to prevent diverticulitis, but there are some things you can do to reduce your risk, such as:
- Eating a high-fiber diet
- Getting regular exercise
- Maintaining a healthy weight
- Avoiding smoking
- Limiting alcohol intake
