 The image is about diverticulitis, a condition in which one or more of the small pouches in the digestive tract gets infected and inflamed. It mostly occurs after the age of 40.

**Epidemiology**
Diverticulitis is classified as a common disorder in India, with over 1 million cases per year.

**Etiology**
Risk factors for incident diverticulitis include:
- Diet: a low-fiber diet, eating nuts, popcorn, and a Western dietary pattern are all associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis.
- Lifestyle: physical inactivity, obesity, and smoking are also associated with an increased risk.
- Medications: NSAIDs and corticosteroids are associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis.
- Other factors: a family history of diverticular disease is also a risk factor.

**Pathophysiology**
The pathophysiology of diverticulitis is not fully understood, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including:
- A low-fiber diet: A low-fiber diet can lead to constipation and hard stools, which can put pressure on the diverticula and cause them to become inflamed.
- Obesity: Obesity is thought to increase the risk of diverticulitis because it can lead to increased pressure in the abdomen, which can put pressure on the diverticula and cause them to become inflamed.
- Smoking: Smoking is thought to increase the risk of diverticulitis because it can damage the blood vessels that supply the diverticula, making them more likely to become inflamed.
- NSAIDs: NSAIDs are thought to increase the risk of diverticulitis because they can damage the lining of the colon, making it more likely for bacteria to enter the diverticula and cause inflammation.

**Signs and Symptoms**
The signs and symptoms of diverticulitis can include:
- Abdominal pain
- Bloating
- Cramping
- Tenderness on the left side of the abdomen
- Diarrhea
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Fever
- Chills

**Diagnosis**
Diverticulitis is diagnosed based on the patient's symptoms and a physical examination. A CT scan or colonoscopy may also be used to confirm the diagnosis.

**Treatment**
The treatment for diverticulitis depends on the severity of the condition. In mild cases, treatment may involve antibiotics, pain relievers, and a change in diet. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary.

**Prevention**
There is no sure way to prevent diverticulitis, but there are some things you can do to reduce your risk, such as:
- Eating a high-fiber diet
- Maintaining a healthy weight
- Exercising regularly
- Quitting smoking
- Avoiding NSAIDs if possible
