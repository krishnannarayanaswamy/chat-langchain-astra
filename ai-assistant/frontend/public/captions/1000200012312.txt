 The image is about anemia. It starts with the definition of anemia, which is a condition in which the patient has reduced hemoglobin, hematocrit, or RBC count. Normal hemoglobin level and RBC counts are as follows:
    In men, the normal Hb level is 13.5-18g/dl, and the RBC count is 4.7 to 6.1 cells/mcL.
    In women, the normal Hb level is 12-15g/dl, and the RBC count is 4.2 to 5.4cells/mcL.
    In children, the normal Hb level is 11 to 16g/dl, and the RBC count is 4 to 5.5 cells/mcL.
The decreased count of RBCs can stem from three different routes:
Loss of blood (Hemorrhage, surgery, heavy menstrual bleeding, chronic gastrointestinal blood losses).
Lack of RBC production (Ineffective/defective erythropoiesis/lack of erythropoietin).
High rates of blood cell destruction (Sickle cell anaemia, hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia, and macroangiopathic hemolytic anaemia etc.).
Though chronic and simple, anaemia can commonly lead to life-threatening complications.
The global distribution for anaemia is 2 billion, around 30% of the world's population.
Women (especially pregnant, elderly and women of reproductive age) tend to be affected more than males.
In India, the prevalence of Anemia is approximately 50%.
Anemia is classified as a very common disease in India.
It affects more than 10 million cases per year.
