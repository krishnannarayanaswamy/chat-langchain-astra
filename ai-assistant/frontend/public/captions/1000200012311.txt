 Image 2.1: **Antiplatelet drugs**. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and COX-2, thereby inhibiting TXA2 synthesis. Clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticlopidine inhibit ADP-induced expression of GPIIb/IIIa by irreversibly blocking the P2Y12 receptor. Abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban inhibit GPIIb/IIIa directly. Ristocetin activates vWF to bind GPIb. Failure of aggregation with ristocetin assay occurs in von Willebrand disease and Bernard-Soulier syndrome.

Image 2.2: **Vitamin K cycle**. Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the Î³-carboxylation of specific glutamic acid residues in coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C, S, and Z. The vitamin K-dependent carboxylase converts vitamin K 1,2-epoxide to vitamin K (quinone) in a reaction that requires reduced glutathione. The oxidized vitamin K is then reduced back to vitamin K 1,2-epoxide by vitamin K epoxide reductase, an NAD(P)H-dependent enzyme.
