 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disorder characterized by persistent airflow limitation, inflammation, and structural damage to the airways and lung parenchyma, leading to chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

**Epidemiology**
COPD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting an estimated 384 million people, with a global prevalence of around 10%.
It is currently the third leading cause of death globally, primarily affecting older adults and individuals with a history of smoking.

**Aetiology**
The primary risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoke, accounting for approximately 85-90% of cases.
Other risk factors include:
- Exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution
- Occupational exposure to dust and chemicals
- History of respiratory infections
- Genetic predisposition (e.g., alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency).

**Clinical Features**
Refer Flow Chart 23.2

**Stages of COPD:**
- Mild:
 - May have no symptoms
 - Winded with moderate exercise or walking upstairs
 - Airflow=80% of normal
- Moderate:
 - Frequent stops to catch breath
 - Coughing or wheezing and breathlessness
 - Airflow=50% to 79% of normal
- Very Severe
 - Low oxygen levels
 - Constant shortness of breath. Flare ups and exacerbations can be life - threatening
 - Airflow=less than 30% normal
- Severe:
 - Shortness of breath worsens. Frequent flare ups or exacerbations that leads to hospitalization
 - Worsening symptoms
 - Airflow=30% to 50% of normal

**Diagnosis**
- Clinical history: Evaluation of patient history, including symptoms (chronic cough, sputum production, dyspnea), risk factors (smoking, environmental exposures), and the progression of symptoms over time.
- Physical examination: Assessment for signs of COPD, such as wheezing, prolonged expiration, barrel chest, cyanosis, or use of accessory muscles during respiration.
- Spirometry: The gold standard for diagnosing COPD involves the measurement of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). A post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.70 confirms the presence of airflow obstruction consistent with COPD.
- Arterial blood gas analysis: May be performed to evaluate the severity of hypoxia or hypercapnia in patients with advanced COPD or during acute exacerbations.
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency testing: Indicated in cases with early-onset COPD, a family history of AAT deficiency, or severe emphysema with minimal or no exposure to risk factors.
- Chest X-ray: Although not specific for COPD, it may show signs of hyperinflation, flattened diaphragms, or bullae (emphysema) and help rule out other lung conditions.
