 The image shows a diagram of a muscle fiber. The fiber is composed of myofibrils, which are made up of thick and thin filaments. The thick filaments are composed of myosin, while the thin filaments are composed of actin. The filaments are arranged in a repeating pattern, with the thick filaments forming the A band and the thin filaments forming the I band. The Z disc is a thin line that runs through the center of the I band and marks the boundary between two adjacent sarcomeres. The sarcomere is the basic unit of muscle contraction.

When a muscle contracts, the thick and thin filaments slide past each other, causing the A band to shorten and the I band to lengthen. This process is driven by the hydrolysis of ATP, which provides the energy needed to power the contraction. The force generated by the contraction is transmitted to the tendons, which attach the muscles to the bones.

The type of muscle contraction that occurs depends on the load that is placed on the muscle. If the load is light, the muscle will contract isotonically, meaning that the muscle will shorten while the load moves. If the load is heavy, the muscle will contract isometrically, meaning that the muscle will not shorten but will instead generate force against the load.

Muscle contractions are essential for movement, and they also play a role in maintaining posture and stabilizing joints.
