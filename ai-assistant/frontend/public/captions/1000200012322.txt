 The image is a table that summarizes the differences between acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). ALL is the most common childhood cancer, while CLL is more common in adults. ALL is caused by the overproduction of immature white blood cells, while CLL is caused by the overproduction of mature white blood cells. Symptoms of ALL include fatigue, bruising, and bone pain, while symptoms of CLL include swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, and easy bruising. Treatment for ALL typically involves chemotherapy, while treatment for CLL may include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or stem cell transplant.
The table is divided into two parts. The first part describes ALL. The second part describes CLL.
The first part of the table has three columns. The first column is labeled "Normal Blood". The second column is labeled "Leukemia". The third column is labeled "Refer Flow Chart 5.1".
The second part of the table has three columns. The first column is labeled "Stage". The second column is labeled "Characteristics". The third column is labeled "Refer Flow Chart 5.2".
The flowchart in the first part of the table shows the steps involved in diagnosing ALL. The flowchart in the second part of the table shows the steps involved in diagnosing CLL.
