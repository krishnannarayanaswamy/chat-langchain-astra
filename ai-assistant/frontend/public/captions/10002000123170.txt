 **Image Description**

The image shows the anatomy of the kidney and its components.

**The Kidneys**

The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located on either side of the spine, just below the rib cage. They are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood and producing urine.

**The Nephrons**

The nephrons are the functional units of the kidneys. Each kidney contains about 1 million nephrons. The nephrons are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood and producing urine.

**The Renal Cortex**

The renal cortex is the outer layer of the kidney. It contains the glomeruli, which are small clusters of blood vessels that filter waste products from the blood.

**The Renal Medulla**

The renal medulla is the inner layer of the kidney. It contains the tubules, which are small tubes that collect urine from the glomeruli.

**The Renal Pelvis**

The renal pelvis is the funnel-shaped cavity in the center of the kidney. It collects urine from the tubules and directs it to the ureters.

**The Ureters**

The ureters are two tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.

**The Urinary Bladder**

The urinary bladder is a muscular organ that stores urine. When the bladder is full, it contracts and empties urine through the urethra.

**The Urethra**

The urethra is a tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.
