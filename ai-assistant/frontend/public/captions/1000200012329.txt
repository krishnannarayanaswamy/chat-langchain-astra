 The image is a table that summarizes the different types of lymphoma, their genetic mutations, clinical features, and biopsy findings.

There are 7 types of lymphoma:
- Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
- Follicular lymphoma
- Mantle cell lymphoma
- Burkitt lymphoma
- Marginal zone lymphoma
- Adult T-cell lymphoma
- Mycosis fungoides

**Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)** is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of large, atypical B cells. It is the most common type of lymphoma, accounting for about 30% of all cases. DLBCL can occur at any age, but it is most common in adults over the age of 60.

**Follicular lymphoma** is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of small, round B cells that form follicles. It is the second most common type of lymphoma, accounting for about 20% of all cases. Follicular lymphoma typically occurs in adults over the age of 50.

**Mantle cell lymphoma** is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of small, round B cells that infiltrate the mantle zone of the lymph node. It is a relatively rare type of lymphoma, accounting for about 5% of all cases. Mantle cell lymphoma typically occurs in adults over the age of 60.

**Burkitt lymphoma** is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of small, round B cells that grow in a diffuse pattern. It is a very aggressive type of lymphoma, and it can occur at any age. Burkitt lymphoma is most common in children and young adults.

**Marginal zone lymphoma** is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of small, round B cells that infiltrate the marginal zone of the lymph node. It is a relatively rare type of lymphoma, accounting for about 5% of all cases. Marginal zone lymphoma typically occurs in adults over the age of 60.

**Adult T-cell lymphoma** is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is caused by the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1). It is a rare type of lymphoma, and it is most common in adults from Japan, the Caribbean, and South America.

**Mycosis fungoides** is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of red, scaly patches on the skin. It is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, accounting for about 50% of all cases. Mycosis fungoides typically occurs in adults over the age of 50.

The table also summarizes the genetic mutations, clinical features, and biopsy findings for each type of lymphoma. This information can be helpful for doctors when diagnosing and treating lymphoma.
