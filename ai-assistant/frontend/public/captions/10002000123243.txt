 ## **Myasthenia Gravis**
- Autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction
- Weakness of the skeletal muscles
- Caused by antibodies that attack the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle cells
- Symptoms:
 - Ptosis (drooping of the eyelids)
 - Diplopia (double vision)
 - Difficulty swallowing
 - Difficulty speaking
 - Muscle weakness
- Diagnosis:
 - Physical examination
 - Blood tests
 - Electromyography
 - Nerve conduction studies
- Treatment:
 - Medications
 - Thymectomy (surgery to remove the thymus gland)
 - Plasmapheresis (a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood)
- Prognosis:
 - Most people with myasthenia gravis can live a full and active life with treatment

## **Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome**
- Rare autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction
- Weakness of the skeletal muscles
- Caused by antibodies that attack the calcium channels on the nerve cells
- Symptoms:
 - Muscle weakness
 - Difficulty swallowing
 - Difficulty speaking
 - Vision problems
- Diagnosis:
 - Physical examination
 - Blood tests
 - Electromyography
 - Nerve conduction studies
- Treatment:
 - Medications
 - Thymectomy (surgery to remove the thymus gland)
 - Plasmapheresis (a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood)
- Prognosis:
 - Most people with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome can live a full and active life with treatment

## **Differential Diagnosis**
- Myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome are two similar disorders that can be difficult to distinguish from each other.
- The following table summarizes the key differences between the two disorders:

| Feature | Myasthenia Gravis | Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome |
|---|---|---|
| Age of onset | Usually young adults | Usually older adults |
| Sex | More common in women | More common in men |
| Symptoms | Weakness of the skeletal muscles, ptosis, diplopia, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking | Weakness of the skeletal muscles, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, vision problems |
| Antibodies | Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies | Anti-calcium channel antibodies |
| Treatment | Medications, thymectomy, plasmapheresis | Medications, thymectomy, plasmapheresis |
| Prognosis | Most people can live a full and active life with treatment | Most people can live a full and active life with treatment |
