 The image is a table that lists various treatments for acne. The treatments are divided into topical, oral, and intralesional.

Topical treatments include clindamycin, nadifloxacin, azelaic acid, and nicotinic acid. Chemical peels, which are concentrated chemicals that are applied to the face and peeled off after 5 minutes, are also used. Other topical treatments include salicylic acid peel, which is used in active acne, and glycolic acid peel, which is used to reduce pigmentation and post-acne scarring.

Oral treatments include isotretinoin, which is the treatment of choice for acne. It acts on all pathogenetic factors, including seborrhea, bacterial colonization, occlusion, and inflammation. The dose is 0.5-1 mg/kg and should be stopped when the dose range reaches 120-150 mg/kg. Side effects of isotretinoin include teratogenicity, so it should not be given to pregnant women. Other side effects include dryness, cheilitis, ocular dryness, headache, and secondary bacterial colonization. Rare but severe side effects include pseudotumor cerebri and diffuse interstitial hyperostosis.

Intralesional steroids are used when deep nodules or cysts are present.

The table also lists hormonal therapy, which is used to treat acne caused by hormonal imbalances. Hormonal therapy includes oral contraceptives and antiandrogens.
