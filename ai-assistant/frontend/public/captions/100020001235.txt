 **+ 1 GENERAL ANATOMY-HEMATOLOGY**

Hematology is popularly defined as the science of study of the blood and various disorders associated with it.

**Blood consists of two elements:**
- Plasma, which is the liquid component.
- Erythrocytes(RBC), Leucocytes(WBC) and Thrombocytes(Platelets): They are the solid components.

The solid components are formed as a result of a process called Hematopoiesis.
Hematopoiesis results in the formation of the solid components.

**Refer Image 1.1**
Formation of blood cells occurs in the bone marrow.
A pluripotent stem cell serves as the mother cell in the bone marrow.
The mother cell is the originator of all blood cells. It has a self renewing property and create further progenitors.

**Erythrocytes**

- Indent
- Hemoglobin-rich cytoplasm
- Biconcave shape

**Structure:** Biconcave, anucleate cells. Organelles absent.

**Function:** Transport of Oxygen to tissues and Carbon-dioxide to lungs.

**Lifespan:** 120 days in healthy adults,
Glucose is the primary source of energy for erythrocytes.

**Both increase and decrease in erythrocyte count indicates an abnormality.**

**Normal range:**
- Male: 4.5-5.9 mil/uL
- Female: 4.0-5.2 mil/uL

**Thrombocytes**

- Structure: Multi-lobed nucleus.
- Function: Participates in acute inflammatory response.
- Contains specific enzymes for inflammatory responses.

**Structure:** Anucleate, Small cytoplasmic fragments
**Function:** Involved in primary hemostasis.
**Lifespan:** 8-10 days.
