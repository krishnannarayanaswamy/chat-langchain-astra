 ## **Cushing's Syndrome**
**Definition**
- Cushing's syndrome occurs as a result of the excessive production of the hormone cortisol by the body over time.
- Taking oral corticosteroid medications can sometimes lead to the manifold cortisol production.
- It can also be caused as a result of the overproduction of cortisol by the adrenal glands.
- Characteristic signs include a fatty hump between the shoulders, a rounded face, and pink and purple stretch marks on the body.

**Etiology**
- Increased glucocorticoid levels due to either medication or internal processes can cause Cushing's syndrome.
- Several possible causes of Cushing's syndrome are known to exist. They can be:
 - Exogenous hypercortisolism
 - Endogenous hypercortisolism

**Exogenous hypercortisolism**
- The most common cause of Cushing's syndrome is due to the administration of glucocorticoids to treat other diseases like:
 - Asthma
 - Rheumatoid arthritis
- Also, as immunosuppressants post-organ transplantation surgeries
- Medroxyprogesterone acetate can also rarely cause Cushing's syndrome.
 - ACTH stimulation is suppressed by the glucocorticoid medication. This can cause the gradual atrophy of the adrenal glands.

**Endogenous hypercortisolism**
- Endogenous Cushing's syndrome is a result of the excessive production of cortisol by the adrenal glands.
- This excessive production of cortisol can be:
 - ACTH-dependent
 - ACTH-independent
- Endogenous Cushing's syndrome can happen in the following ways:
 - Pituitary Cushing's
   - A benign pituitary adenoma secretes ACTH.
   - Also known as Cushing's disease.
   - Is responsible for almost 70% of the endogenous Cushing's syndrome.
 - Adrenal Cushing's
   - Increased amount of cortisol is produced by:
     - Adrenal gland tumors
     - Hyperplastic adrenal glands
     - Adrenal glands with nodular hyperplasia.
 - Ectopic/Paraneoplastic Cushing's disease
   - Tumors which are situated outside the normal pituitary-adrenal system produce ACTH.
   - This gradually affects the adrenal glands
   - Seen in certain diseases such as small cell lung cancer.
   - This is a rather rare case.
   - These tumors have reported to be stimulating pituitary ACTH production.
 - CRH-secreting tumors
   - Risk factors include:
     - Overweight or obesity
     - Type-2 diabetes (Which is not under control) along with high blood pressure.

**Epidemiology**
- The exact incidence and spread of Cushing's syndrome is highly variable across different ethnicities and cultural groups.
- It depends on the frequency of the medical conditions that demand steroid-based therapy.
- It is believed that exogenous hypercortisolism outweighs endogenous hypercortisolism.
- This rare syndrome has an annual incidence of 2 to 3 / million.
- Out of this, benign adrenal adenomas account for 0.6 / million.
