 The image is a table that compares and contrasts the three main types of lung cancer: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. 

The table includes information on the prevalence, incidence, location, risk factors, histological features, high yield facts, and prognosis of each type of lung cancer.

**Prevalence**
- Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for about 25% of NSCLC cases
- Adenocarcinoma accounts for about 40% of NSCLC cases
- Large cell carcinoma accounts for about 10% of NSCLC cases
- Bronchoalveolar variant of adenocarcinoma occurs in about 3% of all lung cancer patients

**Incidence**
- Squamous cell carcinoma is decreasing in incidence
- Adenocarcinoma is increasing in incidence
- Large cell carcinoma is increasing in incidence

**Location**
- Squamous cell carcinoma is usually centrally located
- Adenocarcinoma is usually more peripheral but can be multifocal
- Large cell carcinoma can be centrally or peripherally located

**Risk factors**
- Squamous cell carcinoma is highly correlated with smoking (90% of those with SCC are smokers)
- Adenocarcinoma is most common in non-smokers and the precursor is atypical alveolar hyperplasia
- Large cell carcinoma typically affects younger, female, and non-smoking patients

**Histological features**
- Squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by cancer of squamous epithelial cells, keratin pearls, and intercellular bridges
- Adenocarcinoma is characterized by cancer of bronchial mucosal (glandular) tissue or the alveolar surface epithelium, and mucin positive
- Large cell carcinoma is diagnosed by exclusion, meaning it does not have the features of adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, and is characterized by cancer of type 2 pneumocytes that grows along alveolar septa

**High yield facts**
- Squamous cell carcinoma is associated with hypercalcemia due to increased release of PTHrP
- Adenocarcinoma often has a faster doubling time than squamous cell carcinoma and usually has a worse prognosis
- Large cell carcinoma can cavitate, metastasize early (often to the GI tract), and has a prognosis similar to that of adenocarcinoma

**Prognosis**
- Squamous cell carcinoma is a slow-growing tumor
- Adenocarcinoma is usually a faster-growing tumor than squamous cell carcinoma
- Large cell carcinoma can cavitate and metastasize early, and has a prognosis similar to that of adenocarcinoma
