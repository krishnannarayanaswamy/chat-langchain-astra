 The image is a table that summarizes the classification and management of multiple sclerosis (MS). 

**There are four types of MS:**
- **PRMS:** Progressive Relapsing MS is a form of multiple sclerosis (MS) that is characterized by a steady decline in function from the onset of symptoms, with superimposed attacks or relapses.
- **SPMS:** Secondary Progressive MS is a form of multiple sclerosis (MS) that begins as relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) but eventually progresses to a more progressive course, with steady worsening of symptoms over time.
- **PPMS:** Primary Progressive MS is a form of multiple sclerosis (MS) that is characterized by a gradual progression of symptoms from the onset of the disease, without any relapses or remissions.
- **RRMS:** Relapsing-Remitting MS is a form of multiple sclerosis (MS) that is characterized by unpredictable attacks, or relapses, followed by periods of remission, during which symptoms may improve or completely disappear.

**Management of MS:**
- **Disease-modifying therapies:** These therapies can help to slow down the progression of the disease and prevent relapses. They include:
 - Interferon beta-1a
 - Interferon beta-1b
 - Glatiramer acetate
 - Natalizumab
- **Symptom management:** These therapies can help to manage the symptoms of MS, such as fatigue, muscle spasms, and pain. They include:
 - Muscle relaxants
 - Antidepressants
 - Modafinil
 - Anticholinergics
 - Pregabalin
 - Gabapentin
- **Rehabilitation:** This can help to improve the function of people with MS and to reduce their disability. It may include:
 - Physical therapy
 - Occupational therapy
 - Speech therapy
 - Counseling
 - Support groups
