 The image is a flowchart that describes the management of homozygous hereditary hemochromatosis. 
The flowchart starts with measuring serum ferritin and liver transaminase levels. If the serum ferritin level is <1,000 ng per mL and liver transaminase levels are normal, the patient should be counseled on decreasing or eliminating alcohol intake. 
If the serum ferritin level is ≥1,000 ng per mL or liver transaminase levels are elevated, the patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist for a liver biopsy to determine hepatic iron content and histopathology.
Once the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis is confirmed, iron reduction therapy should be initiated. The goal of therapy is to reduce the serum ferritin level to 50-150 ng per mL. Iron reduction therapy is typically achieved through weekly phlebotomy.
During iron reduction therapy, the patient should be monitored for signs of iron deficiency, such as anemia. The patient should also be evaluated for liver, heart, and endocrine function. Screening hepatic ultrasonography should be performed to evaluate for the presence of cirrhosis.
If cirrhosis is present, the patient should be characterized for any hepatic ultrasonography findings. If there is no liver lesion, the patient should be screened every 6-12 months. If a lesion <1 cm is found, the patient should be screened every 3-6 months and should be consulted by a gastroenterologist. If a lesion ≥1 cm is found, the patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist to evaluate for hepatocellular carcinoma.
