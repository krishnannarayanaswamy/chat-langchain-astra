 The image is a table that lists the different types of pneumonia, their symptoms, and treatments. The table is divided into two sections: one for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and one for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

CAP is the most common type of pneumonia. It is caused by bacteria or viruses that are found in the community. Symptoms of CAP include cough, fever, chills, and shortness of breath. Treatment for CAP typically involves antibiotics and rest.

HAP is a type of pneumonia that is acquired in the hospital. It is caused by bacteria that are found in the hospital environment. Symptoms of HAP are similar to those of CAP, but they can be more severe. Treatment for HAP typically involves antibiotics and intensive care.

The table also lists the different types of bacteria that can cause pneumonia. The most common type of bacteria that causes CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most common type of bacteria that causes HAP is Staphylococcus aureus.

The table also lists the different types of viruses that can cause pneumonia. The most common type of virus that causes CAP is the influenza virus. The most common type of virus that causes HAP is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
