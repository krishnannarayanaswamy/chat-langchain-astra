 **Myotonic Dystrophy**
>Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder that is caused by a CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the DMPK gene on chromosome 19. The disease is characterized by myotonia, muscle weakness, and cataracts. 

**Ocular Manifestations**
>The most common ocular manifestation of myotonic dystrophy is cataracts. Cataracts typically develop in the early stages of the disease and can be the presenting sign. They are usually bilateral and symmetrical, and they typically progress slowly. The cataracts are typically located in the posterior subcapsular region and are often described as having a "Christmas tree" appearance.

**Other ocular manifestations of myotonic dystrophy include:**
>Ptosis
Strabismus
Nystagmus
Glaucoma
Retinal detachment

**Treatment**
>There is no cure for myotonic dystrophy, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment for cataracts in myotonic dystrophy typically involves surgery to remove the cataracts.
