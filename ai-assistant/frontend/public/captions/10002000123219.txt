 **Image 59.1**

The image shows the structure of a skeletal muscle fiber. 

(a) A light micrograph of a skeletal muscle fiber. The dark bands are the A bands, and the light bands are the I bands. The H zone is the region in the center of the A band where there are no thin filaments. The Z discs are the structures that anchor the thin filaments to the thick filaments.

(b) A diagram of the structure of a skeletal muscle fiber. The thick filaments are made of myosin, and the thin filaments are made of actin. The myosin filaments are arranged in a hexagonal lattice, and the actin filaments are arranged in a double helical array. 

(c) A schematic diagram of the structure of a sarcomere. The sarcomere is the repeating unit of a skeletal muscle fiber. It is composed of two thick filaments and a large number of thin filaments. The thin filaments are attached to the thick filaments by the Z discs. 

(d) A schematic diagram of the structure of a thick filament. The thick filament is made of myosin molecules. The myosin molecules are arranged in a helical array. The head of the myosin molecule is the part that interacts with the actin filaments.
