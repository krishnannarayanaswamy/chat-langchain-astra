 + 7 **MULTIPLE MYELOMA**
........
• Myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells.
Also called Kahler's disease.
**Epidemiology**
• Fewer than 1 million cases per year in India.
**Pathophysiology**
• Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of plasma cells
responsible for producing immunoglobulins.
• In this disease, abnormal plasma cells proliferate
uncontrollably in the bone marrow, leading to excessive
monoclonal immunoglobulins (M proteins) production.
• A chromosomal translocation between the immunoglobulin
heavy chain gene (on chromosome 14, locus q32) and an
oncogene (often 11q13, 4p16.3, 6p21, 16q23, and 20q11) is
frequently observed in people with multiple myeloma.
• This mutation results in dysregulation of the oncogene,
which is thought to be an important initiating event in the
pathogenesis of myeloma.
• The result is a proliferation of a plasma cell clone and
genomic instability that leads to further mutations and
translocations.
**Signs and Symptoms**
6 Multiple Myeloma Symptoms
**Anemia**
• Lower-than-normal
levels of red blood cells
can lead to anemia,
causing dizziness and
general weakness.
**Bone Pain and Fractures**
• Bone pain from multiple
myeloma can happen
anywhere in the body,
but most often in the
back, hips and head.
**Excessive Bleeding**
• Due to lower levels of
platelets, which help
with clotting, even minor
injuries or cuts can lead
to a lot of bleeding.
**High Levels of Calcium**
• A buildup of calcium in
the blood can lead to
confusion, weakness,
drowsiness, and lack of
appetite.
**Kidney Problems**
• Proteins released by
myeloma cancer cells can
damage the kidneys;
they're found through
blood or urine tests.
**Numbness**
• Attacks on the bones in
your spine can harm to
your spinal nerves,
leading to numbness and
muscle weakness.
**Diagnosis**
Refer Table 7.1
• Lytic lesions on X-ray:
• In multiple myeloma, osteolytic lesions appear as
"punched-out" areas of bone destruction on X-ray
imaging.
o These lesions are a result of increased bone resorption by
osteoclasts, leading to weakened bones and an increased
risk of pathological fractures.
• Urine or serum protein electrophoresis:
• In multiple myeloma, malignant plasma cells produce
excessive amounts of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M
proteins).
• Urine or serum protein electrophoresis is used as a
screening test to detect the presence of these abnormal M
proteins, which appear as an M-spike on the
electrophoretic pattern.

Bone marrow biopsy:
○ A bone marrow biopsy is a confirmatory test for multiple
myeloma.
○ A diagnosis of multiple myeloma is confirmed when there
is greater than 10% proliferation of malignant plasma
cells in the bone marrow sample.
