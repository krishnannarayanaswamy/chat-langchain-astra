The image shows a diagram of the large intestine. 

The large intestine is the last part of the digestive tract. It is about 1.5 meters long and is divided into four sections: the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon. 

The ascending colon begins at the cecum, which is a pouch-like structure that receives waste products from the small intestine. The ascending colon travels up the right side of the abdomen. 

The transverse colon travels across the abdomen from the ascending colon to the descending colon. It is the longest section of the large intestine. 

The descending colon travels down the left side of the abdomen. It is shorter than the ascending colon. 

The sigmoid colon is the last section of the large intestine. It is S-shaped and is located in the lower left quadrant of the abdomen. 

The large intestine is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from waste products. It also stores waste products until they can be eliminated from the body.
