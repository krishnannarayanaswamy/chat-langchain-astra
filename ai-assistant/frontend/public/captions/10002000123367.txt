 The image provides information about Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) and its types. 
    
    **DCR** is a surgical procedure to create a new opening between the lacrimal sac and the nose. This is done to bypass a blocked tear duct. A blocked tear duct can cause tears to build up in the eyes, leading to infection and inflammation.
    
    **Types of DCR**
    
    External DCR: This is the traditional method of DCR. It involves making an incision on the side of the nose and creating a new opening between the lacrimal sac and the nose.
    Endoscopic endonasal DCR: This is a less invasive method of DCR. It involves using a small camera and instruments to create a new opening between the lacrimal sac and the nose.
    Endoscopic endonasal laser DCR: This is a variation of endoscopic endonasal DCR that uses a laser to create the new opening.
    Transcanalicular laser DCR: This is a minimally invasive method of DCR. It involves using a laser to create a new opening between the lacrimal sac and the nose through the tear duct.
    
    **Comparison of Rhinostomy size at surgery**
    
    The image shows a comparison of the rhinostomy size at surgery for the different types of DCR. The rhinostomy is the new opening that is created between the lacrimal sac and the nose. The size of the rhinostomy is important for the success of the surgery. If the rhinostomy is too small, it can lead to淚道阻塞. If the rhinostomy is too large, it can lead to complications such as infection and bleeding.
    
    **Acute Acquired Dacryocystitis**
    
    Acute acquired dacryocystitis is a bacterial infection of the lacrimal sac. It is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Symptoms of acute acquired dacryocystitis include epiphora (excessive tearing), discharge from the eye, redness, pain, and swelling. Treatment for acute acquired dacryocystitis typically involves antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to create a new opening between the lacrimal sac and the nose.
    
    **Chronic Acquired Dacryocystitis**
    
    Chronic acquired dacryocystitis is a long-term inflammation of the lacrimal sac. It is most commonly caused by obstruction of the tear duct. Symptoms of chronic acquired dacryocystitis include epiphora, discharge from the eye, and mucocele (a collection of mucus in the lacrimal sac). Treatment for chronic acquired dacryocystitis typically involves surgery to create a new opening between the lacrimal sac and the nose.
    
    **Congenital Dacryocele**
    
    Congenital dacryocele is a rare condition in which a fluid-filled sac forms in the lacrimal sac. It is usually present at birth. Symptoms of congenital dacryocele include a bluish swelling on the side of the nose, epiphora, and discharge from the eye. Treatment for congenital dacryocele typically involves surgery to remove the sac.
