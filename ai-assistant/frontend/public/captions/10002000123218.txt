 The image shows the muscles of the legs. There are three types of muscles in the human body: skeletal muscles, smooth muscles, and cardiac muscles. 
- Skeletal muscles are attached to bones and are responsible for voluntary movements. 
- Smooth muscles are found in the walls of organs and are responsible for involuntary movements such as digestion and breathing. 
- Cardiac muscles are found in the heart and are responsible for the pumping action of the heart.

The muscles of the legs are all skeletal muscles. They are attached to the bones of the legs and are responsible for walking, running, and other leg movements. The major muscles of the legs include the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves.

The quadriceps are located on the front of the thigh. They are responsible for extending the knee joint. The hamstrings are located on the back of the thigh. They are responsible for flexing the knee joint. The calves are located on the back of the lower leg. They are responsible for plantarflexion, which is the movement of the foot downward.

The muscles of the legs are innervated by the femoral nerve, the sciatic nerve, and the tibial nerve. The femoral nerve innervates the quadriceps. The sciatic nerve innervates the hamstrings. The tibial nerve innervates the calves.

The muscles of the legs are important for mobility and stability. They allow us to walk, run, and perform other leg movements. They also help to support the weight of the body.
