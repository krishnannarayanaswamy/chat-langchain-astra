 Image 1.1 shows the hematopoietic stem cell, which is the common ancestor of all blood cells. It gives rise to two types of progenitor cells: the common myeloid progenitor and the common lymphoid progenitor. The common myeloid progenitor gives rise to erythrocytes (red blood cells), mast cells, myeloblasts (which develop into neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), and megakaryocytes (which develop into platelets). The common lymphoid progenitor gives rise to natural killer cells, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and plasma cells.

Image 1.2 shows the ABO blood group system. There are four blood groups: A, B, AB, and O. People with blood group A have anti-B antibodies in their plasma, people with blood group B have anti-A antibodies in their plasma, people with blood group AB have no antibodies in their plasma, and people with blood group O have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in their plasma.

The ABO blood group system is important because it determines which blood transfusions are safe. A person can only receive a blood transfusion from someone with the same blood group or a compatible blood group. For example, a person with blood group A can only receive a blood transfusion from someone with blood group A or blood group O. A person with blood group B can only receive a blood transfusion from someone with blood group B or blood group O. A person with blood group AB can receive a blood transfusion from anyone, and a person with blood group O can only give a blood transfusion to someone with blood group O.
