 The image is about allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), a type of skin inflammation caused by direct contact with an allergen.

Other allergens include chromium, which is found in cement, leather, and paint; potassium dichromate, which is found in leather, detergents, and paint; epoxy resins and phenols, which are found in plastics; parthenium, which is found in plants; propylene glycol, which is found in cosmetics and medicaments; PPD, which is found in hair dyes; neomycin and gentamycin, which are found in topical medications; and latex/rubber, which is found in gloves, shoes, and belts.

ACD can be treated with topical corticosteroids, antihistamines, and oral steroids. In severe cases, hospitalization may be required.
