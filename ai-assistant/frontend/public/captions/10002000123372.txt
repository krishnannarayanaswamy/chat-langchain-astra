 **Primary angle closure**

- Primary angle closure is a type of glaucoma that occurs when the angle between the iris and the cornea is narrowed or blocked. 
- This can lead to a buildup of pressure in the eye, which can damage the optic nerve and cause vision loss.

**Risk factors for primary angle closure**

- Some of the risk factors for primary angle closure include:
 - Having a family history of the condition
 - Being over the age of 40
 - Being of Asian descent
 - Having small eyes or a narrow angle between the iris and the cornea
 - Having certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure

**Symptoms of primary angle closure**

- The symptoms of primary angle closure can include:
 - Eye pain
 - Blurred vision
 - Halos around lights
 - Headache
 - Nausea and vomiting

**Treatment for primary angle closure**

- The treatment for primary angle closure typically involves using eye drops or laser surgery to open up the angle between the iris and the cornea. 
- In some cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve the pressure in the eye.

**Preventing primary angle closure**

- There are no surefire ways to prevent primary angle closure, but there are some things you can do to reduce your risk, such as:
 - Getting regular eye exams
 - Controlling your blood pressure and diabetes
 - Avoiding medications that can narrow the angle between the iris and the cornea

**Image description**

- The image shows a diagram of the eye with primary angle closure. 
- The angle between the iris and the cornea is narrowed, which is blocking the flow of fluid out of the eye. 
- This is causing a buildup of pressure in the eye, which can damage the optic nerve and cause vision loss.
