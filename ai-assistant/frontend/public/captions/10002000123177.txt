 The image shows a diagram of the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The diagram shows that CKD is a progressive disease that starts with damage to the nephrons, the functional units of the kidneys. This damage can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity.

As the nephrons are damaged, they are unable to filter waste products from the blood as effectively. This leads to a build-up of toxins in the blood, which can damage other organs in the body. In addition, the damaged nephrons can no longer produce enough urine, which can lead to fluid retention and high blood pressure.

The diagram also shows that CKD can lead to a number of other complications, including heart disease, stroke, and blindness. These complications are often the result of the damage to the kidneys and the build-up of toxins in the blood.
