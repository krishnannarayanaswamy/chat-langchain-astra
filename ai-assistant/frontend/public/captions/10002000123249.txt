 The image is a table of the spinal cord, cranial nerves, and autonomic nervous system. The spinal cord is a long, thin tube of nervous tissue that runs from the brain down the back. It is divided into 31 segments, each of which is responsible for a different part of the body. The cranial nerves are 12 pairs of nerves that connect the brain to the head and neck. The autonomic nervous system is a division of the peripheral nervous system that controls the involuntary functions of the body, such as heart rate, digestion, and respiration.

The spinal cord is divided into four regions: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral. The cervical region is located in the neck and is responsible for the movement of the head and neck, as well as the sensation in the face. The thoracic region is located in the chest and is responsible for the movement of the chest and arms, as well as the sensation in the chest and arms. The lumbar region is located in the lower back and is responsible for the movement of the legs and feet, as well as the sensation in the legs and feet. The sacral region is located at the bottom of the spinal cord and is responsible for the movement of the bowels and bladder, as well as the sensation in the genitals.

The cranial nerves are 12 pairs of nerves that connect the brain to the head and neck. They are responsible for a variety of functions, including vision, hearing, smell, taste, and movement of the face and neck. The autonomic nervous system is a division of the peripheral nervous system that controls the involuntary functions of the body, such as heart rate, digestion, and respiration. It is divided into two parts: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the body's "fight or flight" response, while the parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for the body's "rest and digest" response.
