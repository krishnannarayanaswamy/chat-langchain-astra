 The image is a flowchart that describes the pathogenesis, signs and symptoms, and complications of polycythemia vera (PV). PV is a clonal stem cell disorder characterized by an absolute increase in red cell mass due to increased red cell production. Although erythrocytosis is the main abnormal finding, many patients also have concurrent leukocytosis and thrombocytosis.

The pathogenesis of PV is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a mutation in the JAK2 gene. This mutation results in the activation of the JAK2 kinase, which leads to increased erythropoiesis.

The signs and symptoms of PV are related to the increased blood cell mass. These symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness, and headaches. Patients with PV may also have an increased risk of bleeding and thrombosis.

The complications of PV can be serious and include stroke, heart attack, and gout. Treatment for PV is aimed at reducing the blood cell mass and preventing complications. Treatment options may include phlebotomy, aspirin, hydroxyurea, and interferon-alpha.

The prognosis for PV is generally good, but it depends on the severity of the disease and the patient's age and overall health.
