 The image is about Grave's disease, which is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of the neck. It produces hormones that regulate metabolism.

    In Grave's disease, the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland and causes it to produce too much thyroid hormone. This can lead to a number of symptoms, including:

    * Anxiety and irritability
    * A fine tremor of the fingers and hands
    * Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter)
    * Weight loss despite normal eating habits
    * Change in menstrual cycle
    * Bulging eyes (exophthalmos)
    * Fatigue
    * Thin and red skin usually on the shins or tops of the feet (Grave's dermopathy)
    * Sleep disturbance
    * Unable to resist heat and increase in perspiration
    * Reduced libido
    * Frequent bowel movements
    * Rapid and irregular heart beat

    Grave's disease can be diagnosed with a blood test that measures thyroid hormone levels. Treatment for Grave's disease typically involves medication to block the production of thyroid hormone. In some cases, surgery or radioactive iodine therapy may be necessary.

    The image also includes a table that summarizes the symptoms of Grave's disease.
