 ### Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a group of inherited conditions that damage the nerves in your arms and legs, leading to muscle weakness and wasting.

**Symptoms**
The main symptoms of CMT are:

• Muscle weakness and wasting in the hands, feet and legs
• Difficulty walking
• Pes cavus (high-arched feet)
• Hammertoes
• Loss of sensation in the hands and feet
• Tremor
• Scoliosis

CMT is usually diagnosed based on your symptoms and a physical examination. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography may also be used to confirm the diagnosis.

**Treatment**
There is no cure for CMT, but treatment can help to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Treatment options include:

• Physical therapy
• Occupational therapy
• Orthotics
• Surgery

**Prognosis**
The prognosis for CMT varies depending on the type of CMT you have and the severity of your symptoms. Most people with CMT are able to live full and active lives.

**Causes**
CMT is caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins that are involved in the function of the peripheral nerves. These mutations can be inherited from either parent.

**Inheritance**
CMT is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that if you have one copy of the mutated gene, you will develop the condition.

**Risk factors**
There are no known risk factors for CMT.

**Complications**
The complications of CMT can include:

• Foot deformities
• Joint contractures
• Scoliosis
• Respiratory problems
• Heart problems

**Prevention**
There is no known way to prevent CMT.

**Outlook**
The outlook for people with CMT varies depending on the type of CMT they have and the severity of their symptoms. Most people with CMT are able to live full and active lives.
