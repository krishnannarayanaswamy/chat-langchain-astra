 The image is about Basal Cell Carcinoma(BCC). BCC is the most common type of skin cancer. It is a slow-growing cancer that usually occurs on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, arms, and legs. BCC can also occur on the genitals and in the eyes.

BCC is caused by damage to the DNA in skin cells. This damage can be caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or from tanning beds. BCC can also be caused by certain genetic disorders, such as xeroderma pigmentosum.

BCC typically appears as a small, pearly bump on the skin. The bump may be pink, red, or brown. It may also be itchy or sore. BCC can grow slowly over time, or it may spread to other parts of the body.

BCC is usually treated with surgery. The type of surgery will depend on the size and location of the tumor. BCC can also be treated with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy.

BCC is a curable cancer if it is caught early and treated properly. However, BCC can be disfiguring if it is not treated promptly.

Here are some tips for preventing BCC:
* Avoid exposure to UV radiation from the sun and tanning beds.
* Use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher when you are outdoors.
* Wear protective clothing, such as hats and sunglasses, when you are outdoors.
* Get regular skin exams from a dermatologist.
