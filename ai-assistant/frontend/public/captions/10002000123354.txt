It then lists the causes of SNHL, which can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired (develops after birth). Acquired causes of SNHL include infection of the labyrinth, trauma to the labyrinth or VIII nerve, noise-induced hearing loss, ototoxic drugs, presbycusis (age-related hearing loss), and Meniere's disease. The image also lists the management options for SNHL, which include early detection and intervention, medical treatment, and rehabilitation.

The image also includes a table that shows the different types of hearing loss and their causes. The table also shows the different types of hearing tests that can be used to diagnose hearing loss.

Finally, the image includes a flowchart that shows the steps that should be taken when a person is diagnosed with hearing loss. The flowchart includes information about the different types of hearing aids and other assistive devices that can be used to help people with hearing loss.
