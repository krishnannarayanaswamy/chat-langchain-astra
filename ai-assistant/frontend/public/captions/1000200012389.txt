 **26. BRONCHITIS**

An inflammatory condition of the bronchial tubes, resulting in increased mucus production, coughing, and potential breathing difficulties.

There are two types of bronchitis:
- Acute bronchitis
- Chronic bronchitis

**Acute Bronchitis**

A temporary, short-term inflammation of the bronchial tubes, most often caused by a viral infection.

**Aetiology**
- Viral infections (e.g., rhinovirus, influenza, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus)
- Bacterial infections (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis)
- Environmental irritants (e.g., tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes)

**Pathophysiology**
- Infection or irritant exposure triggers inflammation in the bronchial tubes.
- Inflammation causes narrowing and swelling of the airways.
- Excess mucus production obstructs airflow.

**Clinical features**
- Persistent cough, often with mucus production (clear, yellow, or green)
- Wheezing or shortness of breath
- Chest discomfort or tightness
- Fatigue and mild fever

**Diagnosis**
- Medical history and physical examination
- Chest X-ray (to rule out pneumonia or other lung conditions)

**Treatment**
- Symptomatic relief (e.g., rest, hydration, over-the-counter cough suppressants, and pain relievers).
- Inhaled bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) for wheezing or shortness of breath.
- Avoidance of environmental irritants (e.g., tobacco smoke, air pollution).

**Chronic Bronchitis (Blue Bloaters)**

A long-term, persistent inflammation of the bronchial tubes, typically resulting from ongoing exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke or air pollution.

It is characterized by a productive cough lasting at least three months per year for two consecutive years and is often associated with progressive lung function decline.

**Epidemiology**
- The prevalence of chronic bronchitis varies across populations, with higher rates observed in smokers and individuals exposed to air pollution.
- Estimates suggest that approximately 15-20% of the adult population may be affected by chronic bronchitis, with a greater burden in densely populated cities.

**Aetiology**
- Cigarette smoking (primary risk factor).
- Exposure to environmental irritants (e.g., air pollution, occupational dust and fumes).
- Genetic predisposition.
- History of recurrent respiratory infections.

**Pathophysiology**
- Chronic exposure to irritants leads to inflammation and hyperplasia of bronchial mucous glands.
- Increased mucus production and impaired clearance due to ciliary dysfunction.
- Airway obstruction and progressive air trapping, resulting in decreased lung function.
- Structural changes in the airways (e.g., fibrosis, bronchiectasis) and alveolar damage.

**Clinical features**
- Persistent cough, often with mucus production (clear, yellow, or green)
- Wheezing or shortness of breath
- Chest discomfort or tightness
- Fatigue and mild fever

**Diagnosis**
- Medical history and physical examination
- Chest X-ray (to rule out pneumonia or other lung conditions)

**Treatment**
- Symptomatic relief (e.g., rest, hydration, over-the-counter cough suppressants, and pain relievers).
- Inhaled bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) for wheezing or shortness of breath.
- Avoidance of environmental irritants (e.g., tobacco smoke, air pollution).
