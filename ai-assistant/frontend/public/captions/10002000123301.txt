ART cannot cure HIV, but it can help people with HIV infection to live a longer and healthier lives.
ART reduces the risk of HIV transmission.

The image also shows the steps of the HIV replication cycle. The steps are as follows:
1. HIV binds to a CD4 cell.
2. The virus fuses with the CD4 cell, releasing its genetic material into the cell.
3. The virus's genetic material is copied into the CD4 cell's DNA.
4. The CD4 cell produces new copies of the virus.
5. The new copies of the virus are released from the CD4 cell.
6. The new copies of the virus can infect other CD4 cells.
