 The image is a flowchart that provides a diagnostic algorithm for amenorrhea. The flowchart is divided into two main sections: patients with secondary sexual characteristics and patients without secondary sexual characteristics.
    For patients with secondary sexual characteristics, the flowchart recommends starting with a pregnancy test and serum LH, FSH, TSH, and prolactin levels. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient is referred for further evaluation and management of pregnancy. If the pregnancy test is negative, the flowchart recommends measuring serum testosterone levels and karyotype. 
 Based on the results of these tests, the patient may be diagnosed with a variety of conditions, including hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, PCOS, hypothalamic dysfunction, androgen insensitivity syndrome, or other causes of amenorrhea.
    For patients without secondary sexual characteristics, the flowchart recommends starting with a karyotype and serum testosterone levels. Based on the results of these tests, the patient may be diagnosed with a variety of conditions, including gonadal dysgenesis, constitutional delay, congenital abnormalities, endocrine disorders, pituitary tumors, excessive weight loss, anorexia nervosa, excessive physical activity, or systemic disorders.
    The flowchart is a helpful tool for diagnosing amenorrhea. However, it is important to note that the flowchart is not a substitute for a thorough clinical evaluation. A clinician should always consider the patient's individual history and physical examination findings when making a diagnosis.
