 **Image Description**

The image describes the process of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). It starts with the accumulation of genetic abnormalities in immature lymphoid precursor cells. These cells then divide and accumulate in the bone marrow, expanding the marrow and pushing on the bone. This can cause weight loss, malaise, fever, chills, night sweats, and bone pain. 

As the disease progresses, the neoplastic blasts (cancer cells) fill up the bone marrow and spill out into the blood. This can cause a decrease in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, leading to anemia, infection, and bleeding. 

The image also shows the release of intracellular contents into the plasma, which can cause hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury.

**Text Summary**

- Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer that starts in the myeloid line of blood cells. 
- The myeloid line of blood cells includes red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. 
- AML is the most common type of leukemia in adults. 
- It is more common in men than women. 
- The median age at diagnosis is 65 years. 
- AML is caused by genetic mutations that lead to the uncontrolled growth of myeloid cells. 
- These mutations can be caused by exposure to radiation or chemotherapy, or they can occur spontaneously. 
- AML is a serious disease, but it is curable. 
- The treatment for AML depends on the patient's age, overall health, and the type of AML. 
- Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and stem cell transplant. 
- The prognosis for AML depends on the patient's age, overall health, and the type of AML. 
- The 5-year survival rate for AML is about 25%.

**Flowchart Summary**

The flowchart shows the steps in the development of AML. 

- It starts with the accumulation of genetic mutations in myeloid progenitor cells. 
- These mutations lead to the uncontrolled growth of myeloid cells. 
- The myeloid cells then crowd out the normal blood cells in the bone marrow. 
- This can lead to anemia, infection, and bleeding. 
- The AML cells can also spread to other parts of the body, such as the spleen, liver, and lungs.
