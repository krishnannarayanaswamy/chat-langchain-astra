 The image is a table that lists the different types of treatments for ADHD. The table is divided into two sections: pharmacological and non-pharmacological. Pharmacological treatments include stimulants, non-stimulants, and antidepressants. Non-pharmacological treatments include behavioral therapy, exercise and diet, psychoeducation, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The table also lists the age groups for which each treatment is typically recommended.

Stimulants are the most common type of pharmacological treatment for ADHD. They work by increasing the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, which can help to improve attention and focus. Stimulants can also help to reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity. However, stimulants can also cause side effects such as anxiety, insomnia, and headaches.

Non-stimulants are a newer type of pharmacological treatment for ADHD. They work by different mechanisms than stimulants, and they can be helpful for people who do not tolerate stimulants or who experience side effects from them. Non-stimulants can also be helpful for people who have other conditions that make them more likely to experience side effects from stimulants, such as heart disease or high blood pressure.

Antidepressants are sometimes used to treat ADHD, especially in people who also have depression or anxiety. Antidepressants can help to improve mood and behavior, and they can also help to reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity. However, antidepressants can also cause side effects such as weight gain, nausea, and dizziness.

Behavioral therapy is a type of non-pharmacological treatment for ADHD. It can help people to learn how to manage their symptoms of ADHD, such as by developing coping mechanisms and strategies for staying organized. Behavioral therapy can also help people to improve their relationships with family and friends.

Exercise and diet can also be helpful for people with ADHD. Exercise can help to improve attention and focus, and it can also help to reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity. A healthy diet can help to improve overall health and well-being, which can also help to reduce symptoms of ADHD.

Psychoeducation is another type of non-pharmacological treatment for ADHD. It can help people to learn more about ADHD and how to manage their symptoms. Psychoeducation can also help people to develop coping mechanisms and strategies for staying organized.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that helps people to change their thinking patterns and behaviors. CBT can be helpful for people with ADHD because it can help them to develop more positive thinking patterns and behaviors, which can lead to improvements in attention and focus, as well as a reduction in hyperactivity and impulsivity.
