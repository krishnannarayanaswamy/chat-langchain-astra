 The image is a flowchart that describes the diagnosis of hemochromatosis. 
The flowchart starts with the patient's clinical symptoms. If the patient has clinical symptoms, then the next step is to measure the plasma ferritin level. If the plasma ferritin level is elevated, then the next step is to measure the plasma transferrin saturation (TS). If the TS is elevated, then the patient is diagnosed with hemochromatosis. If the TS is normal or low, then the next step is to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver. If the MRI shows a black liver and white spleen, then the patient is diagnosed with hemochromatosis. If the MRI shows a black spleen and grey liver, then the next step is to perform genetic testing. If the genetic testing shows that the patient has a mutation in the HFE gene, then the patient is diagnosed with hemochromatosis. If the genetic testing does not show a mutation in the HFE gene, then the patient is diagnosed with aceruloplasminemia.
