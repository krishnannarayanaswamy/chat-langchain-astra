 3. Progressive Muscular Atrophy (PMA)

- "PMA - Problems with Muscular Atrophy": This can be used to remember Progressive Muscular Atrophy (PMA), which primarily affects the lower motor neurons and causes muscle weakness and wasting.
- Starts in the small muscles of the hand
- Much better prognosis than ALS (mean duration 3-14 years)
- Bulbar involvement is rare
- Weakness is typically distal, asymmetrical
- Muscle wasting & Fasciculation

**Lower Motor Neuron Syndromes**

- Multi-focal motor neuropathy Mononeuropathy multiplex
 - CIDP
 - Polyneuropathy/radiculopathy
 - Plexopathy
 - Kennedy's
 - Hexosaminidase A deficiency
 - Spinal muscular Atrophy
 - Post-polio syndrome
 - Polymyositis
- Inclusion body myositis
- LMN onset ALS
- PMA

The majority of patients presenting with PMA eventually develop clinical UMN signs.
Post-mortem examinations of PMA patients frequently show pathologic evidence of UMN degeneration.
In some FALS families, the same gene mutation causes the phenotypes of PMA and ALS in different individuals.

4. Spinobulbar Muscular Atrophy
- Originally reported by Kennedy in 1966 - 11 males in 2 families
- Age of onset: Usually begins in 3rd or 4th decade
- Genetics:
 - The most common form of adult-onset SMA
 - X-linked recessive
 - >40 CAG repeats in the androgen receptor gene
- The number of repeats correlates with the age of onset
- Lower motor neuron syndrome with the limb-girdle distribution of weakness/bulbar palsy
- Facial or perioral fasciculations (90%)
- Tongue atrophy with longitudinal midline furrowing
- Prominent muscle cramps
- Generalized fasciculations and Atrophy
- Rarely causes respiratory muscle weakness

**Systemic Manifestations**

- Gynecomastia (60-90%)
- Testicular Atrophy (40%)
- Feminization
- Impotence
- Infertility
- Diabetes (10-20%)

5. Primary Lateral Sclerosis
- Rare disorder (2% of MND cases) with survival ranging between years - decades
- "PLS - Primary Lateral Sclerosis"
- Upper motor neuron syndrome
- Characterized by muscle weakness, stiffness of limbs, and increased reflex response
- Weakness is typically distal, asymmetrical
- Patients present with slowly progressive spastic paralysis/bulbar palsy
- Affects men predominantly - twice as often as women
- Onset usually after 50 years of age
- Survival similar to a normal lifespan
- EMG should not reveal evidence of active or chronic denervation.

Symptoms associated with MND
- Muscle wasting and weakness
- Fasciculation (twitching)
- Cramps
- Spasticity (stiffness)
- Respiratory problems
- Speech and swallowing problems
- Saliva and mucus problems
- Weight loss
- Fatigue
- Pain
- Emotional Lability
- Psycho-social aspects
- Cognitive changes
 - Rarely affected
 - Senses: touch, taste, sight, smell, and hearing
 - Bowel and bladder function
 - Sexual Function and Sexuality
 - Eye Muscles
 - Heart muscles

Management of Motor neuron disease (MND)
There is no known cure for MND, so the management of the disease is focused on improving the patient's quality of life and slowing down the progression of the disease.
Here are some of the management strategies for MND:
1. Medications: Several medications are used to manage the symptoms of MND, including riluzole and edaravone. Riluzole is a glutamate inhibitor that may help slow down the progression of the disease. At the same time, edaravone is
