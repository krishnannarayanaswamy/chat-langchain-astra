**Radiotherapy**

Radiotherapy is a treatment that uses high-energy X-rays or other forms of radiation to kill cancer cells. It is often used to treat kidney cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body. Radiotherapy can also be used to relieve symptoms of advanced kidney cancer, such as pain or bleeding.

**Indications for Radiotherapy**

Radiotherapy is recommended for patients with advanced kidney cancer who have not had surgery or who have had surgery but the cancer has come back. Radiotherapy can also be used to treat patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.

**Side Effects of Radiotherapy**

The side effects of radiotherapy can include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and skin irritation. These side effects are usually temporary and go away after treatment is completed.

**Prognosis**

The prognosis of radiotherapy for kidney cancer depends on the stage of the cancer and the patient's overall health. The 5-year survival rate for patients with early-stage kidney cancer who are treated with radiotherapy is about 70%. The 5-year survival rate for patients with advanced-stage kidney cancer who are treated with radiotherapy is about 20%.
