 The image is a flowchart that provides a clinical pathway for the triage of patients with suspected diphtheria. The flowchart is divided into two main sections: one for patients with suspected diphtheria and one for patients with confirmed diphtheria.

**For patients with suspected diphtheria, the flowchart recommends the following steps:**

1. Assess the patient for clinical warning signs, such as stridor, fast respiratory rate, chest in-drawing, restlessness or lethargy, bull neck, delayed capillary refill, fast heart rate and cold extremities, and central cyanosis.
2. If the patient has any of these signs, they should be given DAT (diphtheria antitoxin) as soon as possible and referred to a hospital for further evaluation.
3. If the patient does not have any of these signs, they should be given antibiotics (penicillin or erythromycin) as soon as possible and monitored for deterioration.

**For patients with confirmed diphtheria, the flowchart recommends the following steps:**

1. The patient should be isolated in a hospital for at least 48 hours.
2. The patient should be given antibiotics (penicillin or erythromycin) for 14 days.
3. The patient should be monitored for deterioration.

The flowchart also includes information on the dosage of DAT and antibiotics, as well as the duration of treatment.
