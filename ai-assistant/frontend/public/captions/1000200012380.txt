 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a group of lung diseases that block airflow. These diseases include emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
    The main symptoms of COPD are shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. COPD is a progressive disease, which means it gets worse over time. There is no cure for COPD, but there are treatments that can help to relieve the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.
    The most common cause of COPD is smoking. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, air pollution, and occupational dust and fumes.
    COPD is diagnosed with a spirometry test. This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out of your lungs.
    There are two main types of COPD: emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
    Emphysema is a condition in which the air sacs in the lungs are damaged. This damage makes it difficult to breathe in and out.
    Chronic bronchitis is a condition in which the airways in the lungs are inflamed and narrowed. This inflammation makes it difficult to breathe out.
    COPD is a serious disease, but it can be managed with treatment. Treatment options include medications, pulmonary rehabilitation, and oxygen therapy.
    Medications can help to relieve the symptoms of COPD and slow the progression of the disease. Pulmonary rehabilitation is a program of exercise and education that can help people with COPD to improve their breathing and overall health. Oxygen therapy can help to improve oxygen levels in the blood.
    COPD is a progressive disease, but it can be managed with treatment. People with COPD can live long, active lives by following their treatment plan and making healthy lifestyle choices.
    The image is a flowchart that shows the pathophysiology of COPD. The flowchart starts with the risk factors for COPD, which include smoking, secondhand smoke, air pollution, and occupational dust and fumes. The next step in the flowchart is the development of COPD. COPD is a progressive disease, which means it gets worse over time. The symptoms of COPD include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. The next step in the flowchart is the diagnosis of COPD. COPD is diagnosed with a spirometry test. This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out of your lungs. The final step in the flowchart is the treatment of COPD. Treatment options include medications, pulmonary rehabilitation, and oxygen therapy.
