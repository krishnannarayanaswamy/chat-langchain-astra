 The image is about percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and ureteroscopy, two procedures used to treat kidney stones. 

    **PCNL** involves the use of a thin and small telescope, called a nephroscope, which is inserted into the patient's kidney through a small incision in the back. The stone is then either pulled out if possible, or broken down into small fragments.

    **Ureteroscopy** involves passing a ureteroscope, a long and thin telescope, into the urethra and into the patient's bladder. Once the stone is located, an attempt is made to remove it. If the stone is relatively large, it is first broken down so that it can be passed through the urine.

    Additional information is provided about the complications of treatment, which can include sepsis, blocked ureter, UTI, bleeding, injury to the ureter, and pain. It is also noted that between 1% and 15% of people are affected by kidney stones at some point in their lives, and that the appearance of the stone can be smooth or jagged, and is usually yellow or brown in color. Because of the increased output of their cardiovascular system, pregnant women are also at increased risk of developing kidney stones.
