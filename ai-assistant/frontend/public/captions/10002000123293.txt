 The image is a table that summarizes the clinical features, treatment, and prevention of polio. The table is divided into three sections: clinical features, treatment, and prevention.

The clinical features section lists the symptoms of polio, which can be divided into two categories: paralytic and non-paralytic. Paralytic polio is the most severe form of the disease and can cause paralysis of the muscles in the arms, legs, or both. Non-paralytic polio is a milder form of the disease that does not cause paralysis.

The treatment section lists the treatments for polio. There is no cure for polio, but treatment can help to relieve the symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment includes supportive care, such as rest, pain medication, and physical therapy. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct deformities caused by polio.

The prevention section lists the ways to prevent polio. The most effective way to prevent polio is to get vaccinated. The polio vaccine is safe and effective, and it is recommended for all children.

The image also includes a flowchart that shows the typical course of polio infection. The flowchart shows how the virus enters the body, multiplies, and causes symptoms. The flowchart also shows the different stages of polio infection, from the initial infection to the development of paralysis.
