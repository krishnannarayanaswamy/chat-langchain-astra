 ## **66 FIBROMYALGIA**
**Introduction**
Fibromyalgia is a complex condition resulting in pain, lethargy and cognitive problems. The exact cause is yet to be discovered. Fibromyalgia could have a profound effect on your quality of life.

**Epidemiology**
- It is twice more common in females as compared to females.
- The peak incidence of Fibromyalgia occurs during the 20-50 years of age.

**Genetics and Physiology**
- Fibromyalgia is known to run in families, establishing a genetic basis of inheritance.
- It does not have a clear pattern of inheritance in families.
- Overall, the risk of developing this condition is about eight times higher for first-degree relatives of affected individuals (such as siblings or children) than for the general public.
- Serotonin and other monoamine receptors, as well as genes linked to metabolism, transport, and pain pathways, are all implicated.
- Hyperalgesia and allodynia result from abnormal sensory afferent pain processing and inadequate descending noxious inhibitory regulation.

**Predisposing Factors**
- Genetic Predisposition
- Environmental triggers such as physical or emotional stress
- Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system
