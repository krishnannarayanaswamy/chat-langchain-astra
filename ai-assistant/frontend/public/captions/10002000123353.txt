 The assistant should start by introducing the concept of hearing loss. Explain that it is a common problem that can affect people of all ages. There are three main types of hearing loss: conductive, sensorineural, and mixed.
Conductive hearing loss is caused by a problem in the outer or middle ear. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as earwax, fluid, or a tumor. Sensorineural hearing loss is caused by damage to the inner ear or the auditory nerve. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as genetics, aging, or exposure to loud noise. Mixed hearing loss is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.
The assistant should then explain the symptoms of hearing loss. These can include difficulty hearing speech, especially in noisy environments; difficulty understanding words; and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).
The assistant should then explain the diagnosis of hearing loss. This typically involves a physical examination of the ear, an audiometry test, and a tympanometry test.
The assistant should then explain the treatment for hearing loss. This can include hearing aids, cochlear implants, and surgery.
The assistant should then provide some tips for preventing hearing loss. These include avoiding loud noise, using ear protection, and getting regular checkups.
The assistant should then answer any questions that the students have.
