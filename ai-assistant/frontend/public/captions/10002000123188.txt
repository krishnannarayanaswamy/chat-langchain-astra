 The image shows a medical illustration of a kidney cancer. The text on the image describes the different types of kidney cancer and the treatment options. 

There are 2 main types of surgery to treat kidney cancer:
- Partial Nephrectomy: This is the preferred option for localized kidney cancer. During a partial nephrectomy, the surgeon removes the tumor and a small amount of healthy tissue that surrounds it.
- Radical Nephrectomy: This is a more extensive surgery that involves removing the entire kidney. It is typically used for larger tumors or when the cancer has spread to other parts of the kidney.

Other treatment options for kidney cancer include:
- Ablation therapy
- Targeted therapy
- Embolization

Ablation therapy uses heat or cold to destroy cancer cells. It can be done using a variety of methods, such as radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, and microwave ablation.

Targeted therapy uses drugs that target specific molecules or proteins that are involved in the growth and spread of cancer. Some of the targeted therapies that are used to treat kidney cancer include sunitinib, pazopanib, cabozantinib, and nivolumab.

Embolization is a procedure that blocks the blood supply to the tumor. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as injecting a material into the artery that supplies blood to the tumor or by using a catheter to block the artery.
