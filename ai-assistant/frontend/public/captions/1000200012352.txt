 The image is a table that summarizes the process of digestion. It lists the nutrients that are absorbed in the small intestine, the site of absorption, and the mechanism of absorption.

The small intestine is the main site of nutrient absorption. It is a long, thin tube that is lined with villi. Villi are small, finger-like projections that increase the surface area of the small intestine. This allows for more nutrients to be absorbed.

The nutrients that are absorbed in the small intestine include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals. Carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. Proteins are broken down into amino acids, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream. Lipids are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream. Vitamins and minerals are absorbed into the bloodstream by diffusion.

The mechanism of absorption for each nutrient is different. Carbohydrates are absorbed by active transport. Proteins are absorbed by facilitated diffusion. Lipids are absorbed by micelle formation. Vitamins and minerals are absorbed by diffusion.

The small intestine is a very important organ in the digestive system. It is responsible for absorbing most of the nutrients that we eat. Without the small intestine, we would not be able to get the nutrients we need to survive.
