 ## Endometrial Carcinoma

**Introduction**
- Most common gynaecological malignancy in postmenopausal women.
- Incidence of Malignant Gynecological Lesions: endometrium > ovary > cervix > vulva > vagina > fallopian tube

**Epidemiology**
- Most common gynaecological malignancy
- 2-3% of women develop it in their lifetime.
- A disease of postmenopausal women.
- 15%-25% of postmenopausal women with bleeding have endometrial cancer.
- The mean age is 60 years.
- Uncommon before the age of 40 years.

**Risk Factors**
- Any factor that rises the level or time of exposure to estrogen is a risk factor for endometrial carcinoma
- Older age.
- Family history of endometrial carcinoma
- Early menarche.
- Late menopause.
- Nulliparity.
- Unopposed estrogen (Obesity, PCOS, HRT).
- Chronic Tamoxifen use.
- Previous pelvic irradiation.
- Hypertension
- Diabetes mellitus.
- Cancer (Ovarian, breast, colon)

**Protective Factors**
- Any factor that lowers the level or time of exposure to estrogen is a protective factor against endometrial carcinoma
- Multiparity
- Smoking.
- Combined Oral contraceptive use
- Physical activity

**Symptoms**
- Heavy menstrual bleeding in younger women.
- Bleeding from vagina after menopause.
- Bleeding between periods.
- Pain in the pelvis.

**Classification**
- Type 1
 - Associated hyper-estrogenism.
 - Associated with hyperplasia.
 - Patients are usually peri-menopausal.
 - Estrogen & progesterone receptors common.
 - Usually endometrioid & mucinous subtypes.
 - Favourable prognosis.
- Type 2
 - Mostly estrogen-independent.
 - Usually atrophic endometrium.
 - Postmenopausal patients.
 - Estrogen & progesterone receptors uncommon.
 - Usually serous or clear cell subtypes.
 - Aggressive, poor prognosis.

- Endometrioid - Adenocarcinoma (most common 80%).
- Adeno-squamous carcinoma (15%).
- Papillary serous carcinoma, Clear cell carcinoma (3-4% overall).
- Endometrial cancer is the most common type of uterine cancer
- Tumour cells can ana

**Spread**
- The direct extension (MC)
- Lymphatics
- Trans-tubally
- Haematogenous (Lungs)

**Differential Diagnoses**
- Adenomyosis
- Uterine leiomyoma
- Coagulopathy
- Polyps
- Pelvic inflammatory disease
- Benign endometrial hyperplasia

**Diagnosis**
- Majority are diagnosed early, when surgery alone may be adequate for cure.
- History + Physical examination.
- CBC
- Transvaginal Ultrasound (endometrial thickness). Findings suggestive of endometrial carcinoma:
