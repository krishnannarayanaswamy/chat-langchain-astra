Text:
Nephritic Syndrome
- Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis
- Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis
- Berger disease (IgA glomerulonephropathy)
- Alport Syndrome

Nephrotic Syndrome
- Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
- Membranous nephropathy
- Minimal change disease
- Amyloidosis
- Diabetic glomerulonephropathy

Minimal Change Disease
- Idiopathic, NSAIDs, lymphoma, allergies
- Normal glomeruli
- Effacement of podocyte foot processes

Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis
- Idiopathic, genetic, HIV, heroin use, obesity, hypertension
- Sclerosis and hyalinosis in a segment of glomeruli
- Effacement of podocyte foot processes

Membranous Nephropathy
- Idiopathic, autoimmune diseases (e.g., SLE), infections, drugs, malignancies
- Thickening of glomerular capillary walls, "spike" formations
- Subepithelial electron-dense immune deposits, thickening of basement membrane

Diabetic Nephropathy
- Long-standing diabetes mellitus
- Diffuse or nodular thickening of glomerular mesangial expansion, Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules
- Diffuse or nodular thickening of glomerular basement membrane, mesangial expansion

Amyloid Nephropathy
- Primary (AL) amyloidosis, secondary (AA) amyloidosis due to chronic inflammatory conditions
- Amorphous, eosinophilic, acellular deposits in mesangium and glomerular capillary walls, Congo red stain shows apple-green birefringence under polarized light
- Fibrillary, non-branching amyloid deposits
