 The image is about secondary amenorrhea. It starts with an introduction that defines secondary amenorrhea as the absence of menstrual periods for 6 months in a woman who had previously been regular or for 12 months in a woman who had irregular periods without any physiological reasons. The most common cause of secondary amenorrhea in reproductive-age women is pregnancy, and this should always be excluded by physical exam and laboratory testing for the pregnancy hormone - HCG.

The image then goes on to discuss the etiology of secondary amenorrhea. The causes are divided into two main categories: endocrine causes and outflow tract and anatomical causes.

Endocrine causes include:
- Hypothyroidism
- Cushing's
- Adrenal tumour
- An ovarian tumour (androgen)

Outflow tract and anatomical causes include:
- Premature ovarian failure
- PCOS
- Surgical removal
- Asherman's Syndrome (damage to the endometrium with adhesion formation)
- Hysterectomy
- Endometrial ablation
- Stenosis of the cervix following cone biopsy

The image also includes a table that summarizes the causes of secondary amenorrhea.

Finally, the image concludes with a discussion of the treatment of secondary amenorrhea. The treatment depends on the cause of the condition. In some cases, treatment may not be necessary. In other cases, treatment may involve medication, surgery, or a combination of both.
