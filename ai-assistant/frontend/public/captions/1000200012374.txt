 ## Asthma: Pathogenesis
**Genetic factors**
(i.e. HLA gene mutations, defects in bronchial airway epithelium)

**Environmental factors**
(i.e. excess hygiene, fewer siblings, two antibiotics in the first year)

Atopy:
predisposition to allergic sensitization to triggers which binds to IgE on mast cell surfaces.

Stimulation of B-cells to produce IgE which binds to mast cell surfaces.

First exposure to allergen:
(35 hrs)

Activated mast cells now IgE-sensitized

Second exposure to triggers:
(2-4 hrs)

Delayed response

Third exposure to triggers:
(35 hrs)

Note: Delayed response peaks within 6-8 hrs and resolves within 24 hrs.

**Asthma:**
Defined as airway hyper-responsiveness causing variable and reversible airflow obstruction.

**Triggers of airway hyper-responsiveness:**
- Allergens (e.g. pollens, animal danders, house dust mites, molds, cockroaches)
- Air pollution
- Cigarette smoke
- NSAIDs/Aspirin
- Exercise
- Cold dry air
- Stress

**Upper respiratory tract infections** (especially in children)

Mast cells release mediators (e.g. histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins)

Inflammation of bronchial mucosa

Increased vascular permeability and edema

Goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus secretion

Bronchial smooth muscle contraction

Thickening of basement membrane

Airway obstruction

- Eyes
- Nose
- Bronchiolitis
- Rhinitis
- Asthma
