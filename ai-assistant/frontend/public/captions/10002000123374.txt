 The image is a table that summarizes the different types of glaucoma, their causes, and treatments. The table is divided into two sections: primary open-angle glaucoma and secondary glaucoma.

**Primary open-angle glaucoma** is the most common type of glaucoma. It is caused by a gradual buildup of pressure in the eye, which can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss. The risk factors for primary open-angle glaucoma include age, race, family history, and certain medical conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

**Secondary glaucoma** is caused by another underlying condition, such as an eye injury, inflammation, or a tumor. The treatment for secondary glaucoma depends on the underlying cause.

The table provides a detailed overview of the different types of glaucoma, their causes, and treatments. It is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about this condition.
