NEUROFIBROMATOSIS
Introduction
•
•
Neurofibromatosis (NF) is an autosomal-dominant genetic
disorder.
It results in nervous system tumours that can occur in all 3
germ layers.
It causes small (usually benign) tumours in the nervous
system and skin which grow from neural crest cells
(Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes, melanocytes, etc.)
NF causes tumours to grow anywhere on or in the body.
Epidemiology
Neurofibromatosis is a rare condition.
•
•
It is also called von Recklinghausen syndrome after
Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen, who discovered it in
1882.
○ Hereditary multiple neurofibromas.
○ Autosomal dominant with high rate of penetrance.
• The NF1 gene on chromosome 17 is affected
Diagnostic Criteria - Tow or more of the following
1. Lisch nodules - iris hamartomas (2 or more)
2. First degree relative with NF1
3. Optic Glioma
4. Cafe-au-lait macules - Light brown pigmented lesions
5. Freckling in the axilla or inguinal region
6. Distinct osseous lesion
e.g.
• Spinal deformities (e.g scoliosis)
o Bowing of the tibia / forearm
• Thinning of the long bone cortex +/- pseudo-arthrosis
7. Neurofibromas (Benign nerve sheath tumour) (2 or more
of any type or 1 plexiform neurofibroma)
This causes tumours to develop in the peripheral nervous
system or along the optic nerve.
Neurofibromatosis 2
•
•
•
It occurs in 1:2600 to 1:3000 individuals.
•
•
Types
Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)
Neurofibromatosis 2 (Nf2)
Signs & Symptoms
•
First appears most often in children ages 3-16
•
•
•
•
•
Presence of brown café au lait spots. These distinctive spots
don't hurt or itch and never progress to anything more serious
than spots.
Learning Disabilities
Bone Deformities
Pain
Numbness and Dizziness
Trouble Sleeping
Aetiology and Pathophysiology
Neurofibromatosis 1
•
Caused by a mutation in the NF1 (Neurofibromin1) gene.
○ Chromosome 17 on the long arm (q) at position 11.2
○ Has 60 exons and over 8500 base pairs
• Encodes for Neurofibromin (tumour suppressor)
NF1 is the more common form of the disease.
•
Caused by a mutation in the NF2 gene.
O Chromosome 22 at location q 11-13.1.
o Encodes a protein called MERLIN (Moesin-Ezrin-
Radixin-Like Protein) (tumour suppressor)
NF2 is also known as Bilateral Acoustic NF (BAN)
• Aless common form ofNF
•
This causes tumours in the CNS, especially in the cranial
nerve VIII connecting the inner ear with the brain.
o Causes various symptoms related to the ear: deafness, ear
ringing, and difficulty keeping balance.
Brain Tumours:
Bilateral Vestibular Schwannomas (VS)
•
•
Other cranial Schwannomas
•
•
Multiple meningiomas
Gliomas
Cafe-au-Lait
Skin markings
Ocular Involvement
•
•
•
Intracrnial and intraorbital tumors
Posterior subcapsular lens opacity (cataract)
Retinal Hamartoma
•
Diplopia
