Malignant Melanoma Skin Cancer
+ A malignant tumor arising from melanocytes
+ Metastasis is seen

Predisposing factors
+ Precursor lesions
+ UV radiation (controversial)
+ Genetics (CDKN2A)
+ Western population

Precursor Lesions
+ Atypical Nevi
+ Usually large size (>5 mm)
+ Irregularly distributed colors
+ Tendency to emerge after young age

+ Dysplastic Nevi
+ Distinct patterns which are interpreted either as a pattern of nevus growth or as pre-malignant status

Identification of Malignant Melanoma
+ ABCDE rule
+ A: Asymmetry
+ Moles that have an asymmetrical appearance
+ B: Border
+ A mole that has blurry and/or jagged edges
+ C: Color
+ A mole that has more than one color
+ D: Diameter
+ Moles with a diameter larger than a pencil eraser (6 mm or 1/4 inch)
+ E: Evolution
+ A mole that has gone through sudden changes in size, shape, and color

+ CMN
+ Large CMN (>20 cm)
+ More often located on the trunk and present with satellites

Common Nevi
+ Risk of transformation very low
+ Highest risk is with junctional nevi
+ Dysplastic/Atypical Nevi

+ Dermoscopy
+ Histopathology - Gold standard
