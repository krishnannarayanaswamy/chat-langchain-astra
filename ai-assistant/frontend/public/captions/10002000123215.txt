 The image is about endometrial cancer staging. It starts with the definition of endometrial cancer and then discusses the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of endometrial cancer. The image also includes a table that summarizes the different stages of endometrial cancer.

Symptoms of endometrial cancer include:

* Vaginal bleeding after menopause
* Pelvic pain
* Painful intercourse
* Abnormal vaginal discharge
* Weight loss
* Fatigue

Diagnosis of endometrial cancer is made by endometrial biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the endometrium and examined under a microscope.

Treatment of endometrial cancer depends on the stage of the cancer. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.

The table below summarizes the different stages of endometrial cancer.

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| IA | The cancer is confined to the endometrium. |
| IB | The cancer has invaded the myometrium, but not the cervix. |
| IIA | The cancer has invaded the cervix, but not the parametria or vagina. |
| IIB | The cancer has invaded the parametria or vagina, but not the pelvic sidewall or lymph nodes. |
| IIIA | The cancer has invaded the pelvic sidewall or lymph nodes, but not the lungs or other distant organs. |
| IIIB | The cancer has invaded the lungs or other distant organs. |
| IV | The cancer has recurred after treatment. |

The prognosis for endometrial cancer depends on the stage of the cancer. The earlier the cancer is diagnosed and treated, the better the prognosis.
