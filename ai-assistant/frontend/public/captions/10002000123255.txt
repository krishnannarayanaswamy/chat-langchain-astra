There is a table that summarizes the progression of Alzheimer's disease. The table shows the different stages of the disease, the symptoms associated with each stage, and the typical duration of each stage.

There is also a flowchart that shows the diagnostic process for Alzheimer's disease. The flowchart starts with a patient presenting with symptoms of dementia. The patient is then referred to a specialist, who will conduct a medical history and physical examination, neuropsychological testing, brain imaging, blood tests, and CSF analysis. The specialist will then make a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on the results of these tests.
