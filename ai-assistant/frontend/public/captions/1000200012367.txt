 The image is a flowchart that provides a treatment algorithm for peptic ulcer associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. The algorithm is based on the patient's penicillin allergy status and the results of culture and susceptibility testing.

**First-line therapies**

For patients who are not allergic to penicillin, the first-line therapy is a 14-day course of bismuth plus PPI plus tetracycline plus metronidazole.

For patients who are allergic to penicillin, the first-line therapy is a 14-day course of double-dose PPI plus metronidazole plus clarithromycin.

**Rescue therapies**

If the first-line therapy fails, the patient can be treated with a 14-day course of bismuth plus PPI plus tetracycline plus metronidazole.

If the second-line therapy fails, the patient can be treated with a 14-day course of PPI plus clarithromycin plus levofloxacin with or without bismuth.

**Culture and susceptibility testing**

Culture and susceptibility testing should be performed to determine the susceptibility of the H. pylori strain to the antibiotics that are being considered for treatment.

If culture and susceptibility testing is not available, the patient can be treated with a 10-day course of rifabutin plus PPI plus amoxicillin.
