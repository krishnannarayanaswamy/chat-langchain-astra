 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a group of lung diseases that block airflow. These diseases include emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
    The most common cause of COPD is smoking. Other causes include exposure to secondhand smoke, air pollution, and occupational dust and fumes.
    COPD is a progressive disease, which means it gets worse over time. There is no cure for COPD, but treatment can help to relieve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.
    The main symptoms of COPD are shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. Other symptoms may include fatigue, weight loss, and swelling in the feet.
    COPD is diagnosed with a variety of tests, including spirometry, chest X-ray, and blood tests.
    Treatment for COPD includes medications, such as bronchodilators, steroids, and antibiotics. Other treatments include oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, and surgery.
    COPD is a serious disease, but it can be managed with proper treatment. People with COPD can live long, active lives.
    The image shows the pathogenesis of COPD. 
    The first step is the environmental insult to the lungs which can be caused by cigarette smoke, pollution, or infection. This leads to an inflammatory response in the lungs with the release of free radicals and cytokines. This inflammation causes damage to the lung tissue and leads to the development of COPD.
    The second step is the genetic susceptibility which can increase the risk of developing COPD. This is because people with certain genetic mutations are more likely to develop COPD when exposed to environmental insults.
    The third step is the chronic bronchitis which is a condition in which the airways become inflamed and narrowed. This makes it difficult to breathe and can lead to the development of COPD.
    The fourth step is the emphysema which is a condition in which the alveoli in the lungs are damaged. This makes it difficult for the lungs to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide, which can lead to the development of COPD.
