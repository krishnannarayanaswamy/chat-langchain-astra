 ## Parkinson's Disease

- **Definition**
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease.

- **Epidemiology**
The prevalence of PD is approximately 2% in the population over the age of 65 years. The incidence of PD is approximately 1% per 1,000 population per year.

- **Etiology**
The exact cause of PD is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The most important genetic risk factor for PD is a mutation in the SNCA gene, which encodes the alpha-synuclein protein. Alpha-synuclein is a protein that is found in Lewy bodies, which are pathological inclusions that are found in the brains of people with PD.

- **Environmental risk factors for PD include:**
 - Exposure to toxins, such as pesticides and herbicides
 - Head injury
 - Cigarette smoking

- **Pathophysiology**
The pathological hallmark of PD is the presence of Lewy bodies in the brain. Lewy bodies are composed of alpha-synuclein and other proteins. The accumulation of Lewy bodies leads to the degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra, which is a brain region that is responsible for the production of dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is involved in the control of movement. The degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra leads to a decrease in dopamine production, which in turn leads to the symptoms of PD.

- **Clinical Features**
The most common symptoms of PD are bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. Bradykinesia is a slowness of movement. Rigidity is a stiffness of the muscles. Resting tremor is a tremor that occurs when the muscles are at rest. Postural instability is a difficulty with balance.

- **Other symptoms of PD can include:**
 - Speech problems
 - Swallowing problems
 - Cognitive impairment
 - Mood disorders
 - Sleep problems

- **Diagnosis**
The diagnosis of PD is based on the patient's history and physical examination. There is no single test that can definitively diagnose PD. However, a variety of tests can be used to help support the diagnosis, such as:
 - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
 - Computed tomography (CT)
 - Positron emission tomography (PET
