 The image is about the muscular system. It starts with an introduction to the muscular system, then it talks about the skeletal or voluntary muscles, their functions, and components. It then talks about smooth muscles.

The muscular system is a system of tissues that allows humans to move. It is made up of skeletal muscles, smooth muscles, and cardiac muscles.

Skeletal muscles are attached to bones and are used for voluntary movement. They are made up of long, thin cells that are arranged in a parallel fashion. Skeletal muscles are innervated by somatic nerves.

Smooth muscles are found in the walls of internal organs, such as the stomach and intestines. They are made up of spindle-shaped cells that are arranged in a random fashion. Smooth muscles are innervated by autonomic nerves.

Cardiac muscles are found in the heart. They are made up of short, thick cells that are arranged in a branching fashion. Cardiac muscles are innervated by autonomic nerves.

The muscular system works with the skeletal system to allow humans to move. Skeletal muscles contract and relax to move bones. Smooth muscles contract and relax to move food through the digestive system and to control the flow of blood. Cardiac muscles contract and relax to pump blood through the body.

The muscular system is a complex system that is essential for human movement. It is important to keep the muscular system healthy by exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet.
