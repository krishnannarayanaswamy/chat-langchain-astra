 9. Disorder of hypothalamus
• The production of TSH is influenced by the production of thyroid releasing hormone (TRH) which is secreted by the hypothalamus.
o Any disorder in the hypothalamus ultimately affects the release and production of thyroid hormones.
Risk Factors
•
•
Women are more prone to hypothyroidism than men.
Major risk factors of hypothyroidism are the following:
○ Positive family history (If a close family member has an autoimmune disease).
○ Race (Being white or being an Asian)
o Age (If you are older, you are more at risk of developing hypothyroidism)
○ Prematurely graying hair
○ Autoimmune disorders such as: Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, Addison's disease, pernicious anemia or vitiligo.
○ Bipolar disorder
• Turner syndrome
○ Down syndrome
Group of hypothyroidisms
Primary hypothyroidism
Causes
• Autoimmunity
• Intervention such as surgery
• Radioiodine
• Radiation etc.
Central hypothyroidism
• Lesions compressing the pituitary
• Metastasis
• Meningioma
• Craniopharyngioma
•
surgery or radiation to the pituitary
• Autoimmune diseases etc.
Subclinical Hypothyroidism
•
•
Affects approximately 2% of children.
It is more common in the elderly and in white people among the adults.
Pathophysiology
•
•
•
•
•
•
In a normal individual, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes T4 which is later converted into T3.
The thyroid gland is the only source of thyroid hormone in the human body.
The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis plays a major role in maintaining the thyroid hormone levels within the normal limits.
TSH which is produced by the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated by the thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH), which is released from the hypothalamus.
Production of both TSH and TRH is reduced by thyroxine by a negative feedback process.
Decline in the amount of TRH affects the release of TSH which in turn affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.
This in turn,
