This diagram shows the **metabolism of chylomicrons and VLDL**. 
After a meal, **chylomicrons** are assembled in the intestine and **VLDL** are assembled in the liver. 
Both **chylomicrons** and **VLDL** transport **triglycerides** to adipose tissue and muscle. 
**Adipose tissue** takes up **triglycerides** from **chylomicrons** and **VLDL** and stores them as fat. 
**Muscle** takes up **triglycerides** from **VLDL** and uses them as a source of energy.

**Chylomicrons** and **VLDL** are **removed** from the circulation by **LDL receptors** in the liver and other tissues. 
**LDL receptors** bind to **apoB-100**, a protein that is present on the surface of **chylomicrons** and **VLDL**. 
When **chylomicrons** and **VLDL** bind to **LDL receptors**, they are taken up into cells by **endocytosis**. 
Once inside cells, **chylomicrons** and **VLDL** are broken down and their components are released into the cytoplasm. 
The **triglycerides** that are released from **chylomicrons** and **VLDL** are used as a source of energy or stored as fat. 
The **apoB-100** that is released from **chylomicrons** and **VLDL** is recycled back to the liver.

**Flow Chart 44.1**

This flowchart shows the **lysosomal storage disorders**. 
**Lysosomal storage disorders** are a group of inherited diseases that are caused by a deficiency of an enzyme that is necessary for the breakdown of a specific type of molecule. 
The molecules that accumulate in lysosomes can damage cells and tissues, leading to a variety of symptoms. 
The symptoms of **lysosomal storage disorders** can vary depending on the specific enzyme that is deficient. 
Some **lysosomal storage disorders** are fatal in infancy, while others are milder and can be managed with treatment.

The following is a list of the **lysosomal storage disorders** that are included in the flowchart:

**1. Hexosaminidase A deficiency**
**2. a-galactosidase A deficiency**
**3. Glucocerebrosidase deficiency**
**4. Arylsulfatase A deficiency**
**5. Galactocerebrosidase deficiency**
**6. Sphingomyelinase deficiency**

**Hexosaminidase A deficiency** is a lysosomal storage disorder that is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A. 
Hexosaminidase A is necessary for the breakdown of GM2 gangliosides, which are a type of lipid that is found in the membranes of nerve cells. 
When hexosaminidase A is deficient, GM2 gangliosides accumulate in lysosomes, which can damage nerve cells and lead to a variety of symptoms, including seizures, developmental delay, and blindness.

**a-galactosidase A deficiency** is a lysosomal storage disorder that is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme a-galactosidase A. 
a-galactosidase A is necessary for the breakdown of a-galactosides, which are a type of sugar that is found in glycolipids and glycoproteins. 
When a-galactosidase A is deficient, a-galactosides accumulate in lysosomes, which can damage cells and tissues in the nervous system, the heart, and the kidneys. 
The symptoms of a-galactosidase A deficiency can vary depending on the severity of the deficiency.

**Glucocerebrosidase deficiency** is a lysosomal storage disorder that is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. 
Glucocerebrosidase is necessary for the breakdown of glucosylceramide, which is a type of lipid that is found in the membranes of cells. 
When glucocerebrosidase is deficient, glucosylceramide accumulates in lysosomes, which can damage cells and tissues in the brain, the liver, and the spleen. 
The symptoms of glucocerebrosidase deficiency can vary depending on the severity of the deficiency.

**Arylsulfatase A deficiency** is a lysosomal storage disorder that is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A. 
Arylsulfatase A is necessary for the breakdown of sulfati
