 Definition
Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which either the body produces insufficient insulin or does not normally respond to insulin.
• This, in turn, causes blood sugar levels to be higher than normal.
• It has many subclassifications, such as:
o Type 1 diabetes
o Type 2 diabetes
○ Neonatal diabetes (due to mutation in the potassium ATP channel pf pancreatic beta-cells)
○ Maturity onset diabetes of the young MODY (non-insulin requiring diabetes which occurs before 25 years of age)
O Steroid-induced diabetes
o Gestational diabetes
The main subtypes are Type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.
Each of them has different pathophysiology, management, and presentation.
Both of them have a potential for hyperglycaemia.
Aetiology
Type 1 diabetes
• Type 1 diabetes is also known as insulin-dependent-diabetes or juvenile diabetes, as it most commonly occurs in children, teens, and young adults.
• In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas produces little or no insulin.
• The exact cause is yet unknown.
• It occurs due to the destruction of beta cells of the exocrine pancreas (only cells in the body that develop insulin).
• Other plausible causes include the following:
○ Genetics: Variations in three HLA class II genes (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1_and HLA-DQB1) involved in antigen presentation cause type 1 diabetes.
○ Exposure to viruses
o Environmental factors
o Chemicals and drugs
Refer Table 40.1
• Factors such as obesity can be controlled to a certain extent, whereas other factors, such as the sex of the individual and increasing age, cannot be controlled.
• The mother's nutritional status during fetal development also plays a role in the development of type 2 diabetes.
• Two types of intestinal bacteria have been connected with type 2 diabetes:
○ Prevotella copri
○ Bacteroides vulgatus
Refer Table 40.2
Important Information
The following are also considered risk factors as far as type 2 diabetes is concerned:
o Heart disease
• High alcohol intake
○ PCOS
• Ethnicity (African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans are at higher risk)
o Gestational diabetes or giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds.
Epidemiology
Type 1 diabetes
• Studies conducted in the year 2021 show that about 8.4 million individuals worldwide have type 1 diabetes (TD1).
• Among this:
○ 18% (1.5 million): <20 years of age
○ 64% (5.4 million): 20 to 59 years of age
○ 19% (1.6 million): 60 years or older
• Males appear to be more frequently affected by type 1 diabetes when compared to that females.
Type 2 diabetes
• Caused due to a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors.
• They include:
○ Obesity
• Sedentary lifestyle
• Increasing age
Female sex
O Genetics
• Studies show that among the 537 million diabetic patients worldwide, 90 to 95% suffer from type 2 diabetes.
• It is common both in developed countries as well as in developing countries.
• It is uncommon in the least developed countries.
• Women are at higher risk when compared to men.
• South Asian, Pacific Islanders, Latinos and Native American ethnicities are found to be more at risk of type 2 diabetes.
• It is increasingly found among children.
