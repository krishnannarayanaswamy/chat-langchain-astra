 The image is about chronic kidney disease (CKD). It starts with the definition of CKD and then talks about the functions of the kidneys. It then discusses the causes of CKD, the risk factors for CKD, and the complications of CKD. Finally, it provides a table summarizing the information on CKD.

The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that are located on either side of the spine, just below the rib cage. The kidneys are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood and producing urine.

CKD is a condition that damages the kidneys and prevents them from working properly. CKD can be caused by a variety of factors, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity. CKD is a progressive disease, meaning that it gets worse over time. If CKD is not treated, it can lead to kidney failure.

The symptoms of CKD can include fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and swelling in the feet and ankles. CKD can also lead to high blood pressure and anemia.

The treatment for CKD depends on the stage of the disease. In early stages, CKD can be treated with lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. In later stages, CKD may require treatment with medications or dialysis. Dialysis is a procedure that helps to filter waste products from the blood when the kidneys are no longer able to do so.

The risk factors for CKD include diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, heart disease, and a family history of CKD.

The complications of CKD can include kidney failure, heart disease, stroke, and blindness.
