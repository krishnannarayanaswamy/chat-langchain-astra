 **Topic: Sickle Cell Anemia**

Sickle cell anemia is a group of blood disorders usually due to inherited defects of the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin.

SCA is associated with malformed hemoglobin in RBCs. Hemoglobin comprises four globin chains (alpha and beta chains).

Sickle cell anemia occurs due to a mutation that replaces glutamine at the sixth position of the beta-globin chain with valine.

This leads to rigid, elongated sickle-like shape polymers under certain circumstances (deoxygenated states).

The symptoms become obvious by the age of 5-6 months.

**Histopathology**
Howell-Jolly bodies- These are the remnants of DNA in the RBC in patients with autosplenectomy due to sickle cell disease.

Target cell.

**Laboratory Investigation**
In sickle cell anemia, hemoglobin electrophoresis result shows 80% sickle cell hemoglobin, 1% to 20% hemoglobin F, 2% to 4.5% hemoglobin A, and absence of hemoglobin A.

In the sickle cell anemia trait, hemoglobin electrophoresis result shows 40% or less sickle cell hemoglobin, normal hemoglobin F, increased hemoglobin A, and 60% or more hemoglobin A.

**Treatment**
Treatments focus on hydration, pain relief, and symptomatic management. As of now, there's no specific cure for sickle cell anemia.

**Complications**
- Acute Chest syndrome
- Splenic sequestration crises
- Acute stroke
- Aplastic crises
- Infections
- Priaprism
- Avascular necrosis of the joints
- Renal complications (hyposthenuria, renal papillary necrosis)
