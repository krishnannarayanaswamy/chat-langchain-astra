 The image is a table that lists the comorbid conditions of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well as the treatments for these conditions. The comorbid conditions listed are intellectual disability, epilepsy, ADHD, anxiety, mood disorders, disruptive behaviors, GI problems, sleep problems, and sensory processing issues. The treatments listed are educational interventions, speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and medical management.

    Educational interventions for ASD include applied behavioral analysis (ABA), which uses the principles of learning theory to change behavior, and speech therapy, which helps to improve communication skills. Occupational therapy helps to improve sensory processing issues, while physical therapy helps to improve gross motor skills. Medical management of ASD includes antipsychotic medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and stimulants.

    The table is a helpful resource for understanding the comorbid conditions of ASD and the treatments for these conditions.
