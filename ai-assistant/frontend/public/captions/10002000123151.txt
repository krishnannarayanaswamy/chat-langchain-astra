 The image is a flowchart that describes the management of hyperprolactinemia in premenopausal women. 
The flowchart starts with a detailed clinical evaluation to rule out secondary causes of hyperprolactinemia, such as pregnancy. 
If a secondary cause is identified, it should be treated first. 
If no secondary cause is identified, the next step is to measure the prolactin level. 
If the prolactin level is elevated, the next step is to obtain an MRI of the pituitary gland to determine the size and location of the prolactinoma. 
If the prolactinoma is small (<10 mm) and asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. 
If the prolactinoma is large (>10 mm) or symptomatic, treatment with dopamine agonists is indicated. 
Dopamine agonists are usually effective in lowering prolactin levels and reducing symptoms. 
If dopamine agonists are not effective, surgery may be considered.
