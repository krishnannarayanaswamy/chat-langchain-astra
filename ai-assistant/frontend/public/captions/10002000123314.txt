 The image is about dermatitis and eczema. It starts with a table that compares the two conditions. Dermatitis is defined as inflammation of the skin, while eczema is a type of dermatitis that is characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed skin. The table also lists the different types of dermatitis and eczema.

The next section of the image is a flowchart that shows the classification of dermatitis. The flowchart starts with the question, "Is the dermatitis exogenous or endogenous?" If the dermatitis is exogenous, then it is further classified into irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, or photodermatitis. If the dermatitis is endogenous, then it is further classified into atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, or stasis dermatitis.

The final section of the image provides more information about each type of dermatitis. Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by exposure to an irritant, such as a chemical or a plant. Allergic contact dermatitis is caused by an allergic reaction to a substance, such as nickel or poison ivy. Photodermatitis is caused by exposure to sunlight after coming into contact with a substance that makes the skin more sensitive to sunlight.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed skin. Seborrheic dermatitis is a skin condition that is characterized by red, scaly patches on the scalp, face, and chest. Stasis dermatitis is a skin condition that is caused by poor circulation in the legs.

The image is a helpful resource for learning about dermatitis and eczema. The table, flowchart, and text provide a comprehensive overview of the two conditions.
