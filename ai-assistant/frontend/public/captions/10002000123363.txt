 The image is a medical illustration of the sinuses. It shows the location of the different sinuses in the head, and the symptoms of sinusitis. 

Sinusitis is a condition in which the sinuses become inflamed. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as allergies, infections, and structural abnormalities. Symptoms of sinusitis can include headache, facial pain, nasal congestion, and a decreased sense of smell. 

There are a number of different types of sinusitis, depending on which sinus is affected. Frontal sinusitis affects the sinuses in the forehead, ethmoid sinusitis affects the sinuses between the eyes, sphenoid sinusitis affects the sinuses behind the eyes, and maxillary sinusitis affects the sinuses in the cheeks. 

Treatment for sinusitis typically involves antibiotics, decongestants, and pain relievers. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct structural abnormalities that are causing the sinusitis.

**Frontal sinusitis**

Frontal sinusitis is a type of sinusitis that affects the sinuses in the forehead. It is characterized by pain in the forehead, above the eyebrows, and around the eyes. Other symptoms may include nasal congestion, a runny nose, and a decreased sense of smell.

**Ethmoid sinusitis**

Ethmoid sinusitis is a type of sinusitis that affects the sinuses between the eyes. It is characterized by pain in the bridge of the nose, between the eyes, and around the eyes. Other symptoms may include nasal congestion, a runny nose, and a decreased sense of smell.

**Sphenoid sinusitis**

Sphenoid sinusitis is a type of sinusitis that affects the sinuses behind the eyes. It is characterized by pain in the back of the head, around the eyes, and in the temples. Other symptoms may include nasal congestion, a runny nose, and a decreased sense of smell.

**Maxillary sinusitis**

Maxillary sinusitis is a type of sinusitis that affects the sinuses in the cheeks. It is characterized by pain in the cheeks, under the eyes, and around the nose. Other symptoms may include nasal congestion, a runny nose, and a decreased sense of smell.

**Treatment for sinusitis**

Treatment for sinusitis typically involves antibiotics, decongestants, and pain relievers. Antibiotics are used to kill the bacteria that are causing the infection. Decongestants are used to reduce swelling in the sinuses and to improve drainage. Pain relievers are used to relieve pain and inflammation.

In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct structural abnormalities that are causing the sinusitis. Surgery may be performed to remove blockages in the sinuses, to repair damage to the sinuses, or to create new drainage pathways for the sinuses.
