 The image is a flowchart that shows the steps to take when a patient has elevated FSH and LH levels. The flowchart starts with the question "Is the patient pregnant?". If the answer is yes, the next question is "Is the ectopic pregnancy ruled out?". If the answer to that question is yes, the next step is to check the prolactin levels. If the prolactin levels are elevated, the next step is to consider a pituitary MRI. If the prolactin levels are not elevated, the next step is to check the thyroid function. If the thyroid function is normal, the next step is to check the adrenal function. If the adrenal function is normal, the next step is to consider a genetic cause.

If the answer to the first question is no, the next question is "Is the patient postmenopausal?". If the answer to that question is yes, the next step is to check the FSH and LH levels again in one month. If the FSH and LH levels are still elevated, the next step is to consider a primary ovarian insufficiency. If the FSH and LH levels are not elevated, the next step is to consider a functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.

If the answer to the first question is no, and the patient is not postmenopausal, the next question is "Does the patient have symptoms of androgen excess?". If the answer to that question is yes, the next step is to consider a congenital adrenal hyperplasia. If the answer to that question is no, the next step is to check the DHEA-S and testosterone levels. If the DHEA-S and testosterone levels are elevated, the next step is to consider a Cushing's syndrome. If the DHEA-S and testosterone levels are not elevated, the next step is to consider a non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
