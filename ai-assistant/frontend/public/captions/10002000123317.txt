DISCOID LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS
Introduction
• A chronic skin condition of sores with inflammation and
scarring favoring the face, ears, and scalp and at times on
other body areas.
• These lesions develop as a red, inflamed patch with a scaling
and crusty appearance. The center areas may appear lighter
in color with a rim darker than the normal skin.
• SLE presents with non-scarring alopecia. But later in
disease, it may become scarring alopecia.
DLE always presents with scarring alopecia
What Causes DLE?
• The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to be
autoimmune with the body's immune system incorrectly
attacking normal skin.
• This condition tends to run in families. Females out number
males with this condition 3 to 1.
• In some patients with discoid lupus erythematosus, sunlight
and cigarette smoking may make the lesions come out.
