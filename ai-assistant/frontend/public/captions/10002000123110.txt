 + 32 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS

DVT, by definition, is a blood clot in any deep vein.
It usually occurs in lower limbs.
DVT is a serious condition due to the potential migratory property of these clots.

**Epidemiology**
DVT is classified as Common.
It affects more than 1 million cases per year in India.

**Etiology and Risk Factors**
The three factors included in Virchow's triad can potentially cause DVT: Venous stasis, hypercoagulability and Endothelial lining changes.

**Factors Increasing Risk for Venous Thromboembolism**
Age>60 (After age 50, risk doubles every 10 years.)
Cigarette smoking (active and passive)
Prior VTE (most significant risk factor for DVT and PE)
Venous stasis (Contributing factors include CHF, MI, major surgery, obesity, sickle cell anemia, stroke, varicose veins.)
Injury to vasculature (Contributing factors include Knee and hip replacement surgery, hip and leg fractures, indwelling venous catheters.)
Hypercoagulability (Contributing factors include elevated homocysteine levels, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, pregnancy/postpartum, hereditary deficiencies, gene mutations.)
Immobilization
Obesity
Medication therapy
Oral contraceptives with estrogen; hormone therapy with estrogen; selective estrogen-receptor modulators (e.g., tamoxifen, raloxifene); heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
Nephrotic syndrome

**Signs and Symptoms**
Swelling of the leg or arm
Pain or tenderness while standing or walking
Feeling of warmth in swollen area
Red or discoloured skin

**Pathophysiology and Clinical Features**
Refer Flow Chart 32.1

**Diagnosis**
The first step of the diagnostic process is an assessment using Wells Score

| Well score | Criteria | Points |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
|  | Clinical signs/symptoms of DVT | 3 |
|  | PE is more likely diagnosis | 3 |
|  | Tachycardia (> 100 bpm) | 1.5 |
|  | Swelling of the leg or arm | 1.5 |
|  | Immobilization/ surgery in previous 4 weeks | 1.5 |
|  | Prior DVT/PE | 1.5 |
|  | Hemoptysis | 1 |
|  | Active malignancy (trt w/in 6 months) | 1 |
