 The image is a table that lists the different types of epileptic seizures, their symptoms, and their causes. The table is divided into two parts: the first part lists the focal seizures, and the second part lists the generalized seizures.

Focal seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in one area of the brain. They can cause a variety of symptoms, including muscle contractions, sensory changes, and changes in consciousness. Focal seizures are often classified according to the part of the brain that is affected.

Generalized seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in both hemispheres of the brain. They can cause a variety of symptoms, including loss of consciousness, muscle contractions, and changes in breathing. Generalized seizures are often classified according to their severity.

The table also lists the different causes of epileptic seizures. Some of the most common causes include head injuries, strokes, and brain tumors. However, many cases of epilepsy have no known cause.

Epilepsy is a serious condition, but it can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes. If you think you may have epilepsy, it is important to see a doctor right away.
