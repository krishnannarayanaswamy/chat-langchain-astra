 The image is a table that summarizes the different types of lipoproteins, their apoproteins, functions, causes, and clinical findings.

Lipoproteins are particles that transport lipids in the blood. They are made up of a core of lipids surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer and proteins called apoproteins.

There are five main types of lipoproteins: chylomicrons, very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), low
