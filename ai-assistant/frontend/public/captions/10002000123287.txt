 The image is a table that shows the classification of smear results for tuberculosis (TB) patients. The table is divided into four categories based on the number of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) seen on a smear. The first category is for patients with a smear result of 4+, which is considered to be strongly positive. The second category is for patients with a smear result of 3+, which is considered to be moderately positive. The third category is for patients with a smear result of 2+, which is considered to be weakly positive. The fourth category is for patients with a smear result of 1+, which is considered to be negative.

In addition to the smear result, the table also shows the infectiousness of the patient. Patients with a smear result of 4+ or 3+ are considered to be highly infectious. Patients with a smear result of 2+ or 1+ are considered to be less infectious.

The table also shows the recommended treatment regimen for each category of patient. Patients with a smear result of 4+ or 3+ are recommended to receive intensive treatment for 2 months followed by continuation treatment for 4 months. Patients with a smear result of 2+ or 1+ are recommended to receive intensive treatment for 3 months followed by continuation treatment for 5 months.

The image also includes a table that shows the different types of anti-tubercular drugs. The drugs are divided into two categories: first-line drugs and second-line drugs. First-line drugs are the most commonly used drugs to treat TB. Second-line drugs are used to treat patients who have failed to respond to first-line drugs.
