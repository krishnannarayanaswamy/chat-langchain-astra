welcome to this Mega revision of microbiology for the upcoming neat PG 2023 now I know this subject is
0:14
definitely a very volatile one and must be giving you sleepless nights because there is too much to cram up and
0:19
obviously in this less time you have to focus on something which is very high yielding so I've got you some of the
0:24
most high yielding topics which we are gonna cover in an image based fashion so yes this is going to be an image based
0:30
session and I'm going to cover the images and the relevant points associated with it I'm starting with the
0:36
segment which is the much ignored I would say and the one that we usually leave for the end and that is
0:42
parasitology so we're starting with paraceto then we'll be going to bacteriology and the envirology so on
0:48
that note let's get going all the best to you guys because it's gonna be a slightly lengthy session but I hope you
0:54
make the most out of it and at the end you find it beneficial let's start guys let's begin with parasitology now the
1:01
first thing that we'll start with is this set of images which all of you are very much aware of you know what this parasite is it's an amoeba which is ENT
1:08
amoeba histolytica what are the quick questions that are going to be asked first they will ask you about this
1:14
particular shape of the ulcer which everyone is aware this is the famous flask-shaped ulcer which you tend to see
1:20
where very commonly seen in the cecum next the same parasite can also infect
1:25
the liver and in the liver it results in this brownish color pus known as the anchovy sauce appearance so now in both
1:32
of these whether it is the flask shaped ulcer or it is the anchovy sauce what I'm gonna see on microscopic examination
1:39
are the trophozoids and now we need to know how do the trophozoids look like so here you have a picture this is showing
1:45
you the trophozoid and this is showing you the cyst form the first thing that you identify are the number of the
1:50
nuclei so in the trophozoit I can see a single nucleus and in the cyst I can see
1:56
a total of four so there are one to four nuclei that we see but it's not just looking at the nucleus I can also have
2:02
to I will also have to see the shape of this structure of the nucleus that is what you get a question on so the
2:08
structure of the nucleus please note it is looking like this we call it the very famous appearance called the cartwheel
2:15
appearance this is the cartwheel nucleus or the cartwheel chromatin because there is a dot in the center there is a dot in
2:22
the center which is a carry ozone and then there are spokes coming out of it so we call it the cartwheel nucleus
2:27
other than that one more feature about trophozoit and one about cyst the trophozoit if you see has eaten up the
2:34
red blood cells trophozoite has engulfed the red blood cells we famously call this as erythrophagocytosis if you
2:40
remember the rbcs are engulfed and the same you can visualize in this picture you can see these pink pink dots being
2:47
eaten right so the rbcs are engulfed and that is what it is going to result in this is
2:52
going to be erythrophagocytosis next what does the cyst form show you the cyst form shows
2:58
you something very very famous known as the chromatoid body so what is the question that we are going to get on the
3:04
chromatoid body firstly you will call it a chromatoidal body or a chromatoidal bar and it's going to show you rnp it is
3:11
going to show you ribonucleoprotein that is what it's composed of you get a question what is
3:16
the composition pyq guys what is the composition of a chromatoidial body it is an rnp
3:22
ribonucleoprotein on that note we are done with this let's quickly tell me the treatment also what are we gonna give to
3:28
the patient we will give metronidazole for 10 days and apart from metronidazole will also give a luminal amoebicide and
3:35
what is that that is paromomycin paramomycin is also given as a luminal amoebaside that is the treatment for
3:41
entamoeba histolytica diarrhea causing organism now there's another diarrhea
3:47
causing organism which is going to be be the next one that you would be studying and I think the features that I've written over here should be easy to make
3:53
you identify what is this this is the famous balantidium coli how did I identify balantidium coli I had to write
4:01
the word b coli once again I wrote B coli what does that mean so now when you
4:08
read coli all of you will be reminded of sea lie so this is the only celiated parasite that we have in the human
4:15
ciliated protozoa so Coli for sea life and after that the B that we have written over here is going to be
4:21
everything big big big so what do I mean by big big big it means that what is the size of this this is the largest
4:28
protozoa invading the human intestine it is a big protozoa which intestine small
4:33
intestine large intestine so big intestine big intestine Matlab large intestine so yes this is going to
4:39
involve the large intestine the big intestine so simple now B for Bell antidium B for big it's big in size B
4:45
for big intestine it involves the large intestine and then finally we are going to know the nuclei so if you weather
4:52
look at the trophozoid or you look at the cyst in all other parasites the cyst will have more number of nuclei we know
4:59
that right but not over here over here the cyst and the trophozoid have same number of nuclei and that is B4
5:06
binucleated whether it is the cyst or the trophozoid they have two two nuclei so whenever I say there are two two
5:13
nuclei Common Sense two means one is going to be very very big one is going to be very very small so there's a
5:19
macronucleus which I'm calling as the big nucleus and then there's a micronucleus which
5:25
I'm calling obviously as the small nucleus so what do you think is the alphabet that I am going to go for be
5:31
big because I know that b for big and B for being this is the bean shaped
5:36
nucleus so guys have a look at the picture above all of you can visualize there is a bean shaped nucleus that
5:42
means it is bellantidium coli put all the bees together B for number one it's the biggest protozoa B for big intestine
5:49
large intestine B for how many nuclei binucleated B for which nucleus is Bean
5:55
shape B big Vala is being shaped the macronucleus over here is gonna be Bean
6:00
shaped these are all the bees that you had to know for balantidium and coli will remind you of silai so this is the
6:06
story of bellantidium Vala diarrhea how are you gonna treat it that's obviously the next question you can either give
6:12
tetracycline or you can give metronidazole that is the treatment that you have for this I hope that's okay B
6:18
coli is also sorted can we go forward we are going to talk about too flagellate and and those two flagellate are going
6:25
to be the story of the angry uncle and the fashionable Auntie what is angry uncle and fashionable Auntie so too
6:30
flagellate coming your way flagellate means first I'll start with the angry Uncle everyone knows the angry old man
6:36
is of the intestine the angry old man is giardia lamblia so I'm going to show you the micro and the path for grdr lamblia
6:44
please note when I'm talking about Giardia lamblia why did I call him an angry old man as
6:50
you see over here so firstly man has two eyes so this Giardia lamblia is gonna have how many nuclear when I look at the
6:56
trophozoid form it is going to have two nuclei but when I look at the cyst form how many does it have when I look at the
7:03
cyst always has more number of nuclear the cyst always has more number of nuclei so I can see four nuclei over
7:10
here other than that angry old man so old man bearded man so how many how many
7:15
flagella is he gonna have he is gonna have four pairs of flagella be very
7:21
cautious with these numbers four pairs of flagella which basically means a total of how many eight Flagyl are
7:28
present so that's his old man beard that you have what is this old man doing this old man is falling in we call him a man
7:36
falling around why do we say falling around because what is the motility that this man shows you this is the Falling
7:42
Leaf motility this is the Falling Leaf motility that this man tends to show you and you know where is he falling around
7:48
look at the pathology picture he is falling around in which part of the intestine he's not falling around in the
7:53
cells he's roaming and falling around like in the Lumen this is a luminal organism that is how you will identify
8:01
it in a pathology specimen because whatever these pictures I was showing you these are the pictures that you will
8:07
see on a diarrhea sample on a stool sample but what if you get a biopsy sample from the intestine there's a
8:13
duodenal biopsy that has been done where will you see him this angry old man will
8:18
be seen falling and roaming in the duodenal Lumen it's a luminal organism please remember and other than that if I
8:25
see the shape has changed when I was showing it to you in this tool for example that was the front view you
8:30
could see this angry old man front side but now I show him to you in the Lumen and he's showing you his side face okay
8:36
showing you a side face so side face means it's gonna look like a sickle shape please remember on a biopsy it has
8:42
a sickle shape or shape that you have to focus on on repeating when you see in this tool sample it usually comes as a
8:49
front face but in a biopsy it's going to come as a side face and side face Matlab we are dealing with the sickle shape
8:55
that is all that you have to know about giardia lamblia in terms of treatment you all know the treatment is
9:00
metronidazole you can also give two gram tinidazole that works well metronidazole
9:06
and 2 gram tinidazole can also be given or single dose that also works well so the angry uncle is done shall we move on
9:13
to the fashionable auntie who's the fashionable Auntie so this is the story of the fashionable Auntie that you have
9:19
that is trichomonas vaginalis firstly wild Auntie because vaginal is sexually
9:25
transmitted disease something in the cervix and the vagina that it causes you all can see this picture it causes the
9:31
very famous strawberry cervix it causes the very famous strawberry cervix now please note this is a
9:38
fashionable Auntie who likes all exotic fruits number one story she likes exotic fruits so she loves the strawberry I can
9:45
see the strawberry cervix and the top of the strawberries having those green leaf so basically the color of the discharge
9:51
that she's gonna present with is a greenish discharge she has a greenish discharge and a strawberry cervix the
9:57
first part of the story strawberry eating fashionable Auntie is done next what are the forms that you'll see
10:02
because I'm talking about trichomonas whether they ask me the infective stage or they ask me the diagnostic stage the
10:09
answer will always be t for T that is trophozoit why because this only has
10:14
trophozoid there is no cyst form that exists in trichomonas so trichomonas is
10:20
all about TTT it is only trophozoid and what is the motility it is also tea for twitching t for twitching motility so
10:26
simple now the story of this trichomonas is trophozoic and twitching motility sounds well what is the media what can
10:33
you see this fashionable Auntie obviously she's Rich she loves Diamond so what is gonna be the media that you
10:39
have over here it is going to be the diamond media Diamond media you might have also studied for entamoeba
10:44
histolytica yes it can be used it can be used here as well moving on to the next now let's look at
10:50
the hairstyle of this fashionable Auntie so when you look at trichomonas first and foremost this auntie is blinded she
10:57
is blinded in the love for money and in the love for materialistic things so blinded Matlab because she's a human
11:03
being but I've not given her two eyes I have given her one eye I have given her one nucleus why because she's blinded by
11:09
all materialistic things she cannot see anything beyond money and Rich things whereas that angry Uncle angry uncle had
11:15
no materialistic things in life so he had two two eyes you could see everything this fashionable Auntie is just running after money and Rich things
11:22
so she has only one eye also she has a very fancy hairstyle look at her hairstyle she has four hair in the front
11:27
and she has one long ponytail going back what did I say she has four hair in the
11:33
front four flagella in the front and she has one long hair going back so they will ask you there are four anterior
11:40
flagella and there is one posterior flagella so total how many flagella does
11:45
this auntie have total of five flagella please don't get confused how many flagella did the old man have the angry
11:51
old man had four pairs means he had eight total flagella this fashionable Auntie has total of five four anterior
11:58
as a fringe cut and one going posterior as a ponytail I hope everyone will remember the story of this
12:04
very famous fashionable Auntie so you're too flagellate are done we are gonna have and yes I hope you know it's an STD so treatment of the partner is also
12:11
important over here right so done with the two flagella what am I going to show you next can you identify this organism
12:17
this organism over here is identified by its C shape in the blood what is the c
12:22
shape yes you guys have guessed it right this is a case of tropanosoma cruisy so
12:28
first and foremost remember that trapanazoma cruisy is going to be C for
12:33
cruisy so the shape of the organism that I'm seeing over here is a c-shaped organism also remember the disease that
12:40
we are gonna study is a sea disease known as a shagaz disease is going to be the chaga's disease that is the first
12:48
sea and who's going on a cruise Romans are on a cruise means what is the sign that it's going to show you romana's
12:54
sign it will show me what is Roman as sign Romana sign is gonna look like this one eye unilateral one eye of the
13:01
patient is swollen there is a unilateral Perry or vital edema that the patient will come to you with they will always
13:07
and always give you this if it is an acute case if it is a starting case they will give you this unilateral edema one
13:14
eye will be swollen so remember the rooms are Romans are going on a cruise the trapanazuma cruzy C for cruisy c for
13:21
C shape organism C for shaga's disease but when this becomes chronic what is it gonna result in later on later on it is
13:28
going to result in something which all of you have studied in surgery and in pathology what happens in the esophagus
13:34
there is mega esophagus what is that condition known as mega esophagus that
13:39
is known Asia cardia it is referred to as achalasia cardia you get a question in
13:45
path also what is the infective cause of achillasia cardiitis ragas disease the
13:50
last one what is the vector tropanazoma cruzica vector is the tri-atomine
13:56
reduated bug the tri-atomine reduid bug right and what is the media
14:03
that you have the media is triple n so quickly make a story where all will you study triple n number one I'm studying
14:10
it over here that is tropanosoma cruisy I will also study it in leishmania means kalasar trapanazuma cruzy and kalasara
14:17
are gonna show me the triple n media so I'll come to colors are also in a while but because I'm talking about
14:22
trapanazoma cruisy let me talk about his cousin brother that is trapanazuma Brucie also so what is tropanosoma Bruce
14:29
guys topanazuma bruceies of two types I hope you remember trapanazuma bruces
14:34
trapanazuma Brucie gambiance and rhodesians I know by now you might also be feeling that instead of putting the
14:41
video on a 2X speed it's already working on a 2X speed but that is how it's supposed to be because it's a mega
14:46
revision and we have loads of things to discuss right so let's get going when we have trapanazuma Brucie gambians and
14:52
rhodesians you know what do they cause they Cause sleeping sickness so the question is where is East African and
14:57
where is West African so I have a simple demonic you'll think of the sun where does the sun rise the sun rises in the
15:04
East and where does the sun set means game over game over it's gonna be in the
15:10
west so simple where does the sun rise Rising is going to be in the East so East African and where is it going to
15:17
set where is it going to be like game over game over is going to be West African sleeping sickness and because
15:22
you're calling it what disease SNS sleeping sickness sleeping sickness what is gonna be the vector SS that is the
15:30
vector for both is the cc fly the vector is SS fly that
15:35
is how you can remember SS fly will cause sleeping sickness how will the patient present of course from having
15:41
sleeping sickness is there any sign there's a very famous sign called the winter bottom sign what is winter bottom
15:48
sign firstly winter bottom sign is nothing but a case of lymphadenopathy patient will have big lymph nodes in the
15:54
neck lymphadenopathy hotel but remember W for w winter bottom sign is seen in
15:59
which African sleeping sickness West African sleeping sickness so w for w is again an expected question lastly how do
16:07
you treat so firstly there are two drugs that we have that is we have the presence of pentamidine and pseudamin so
16:13
for West African we use pentamidine but for East African we have to use Surah meanwhai because East African sleeping
16:21
sickness is more virulent how did I learn that so you need a stronger drug it is more virulent because Rising the
16:27
rise of everyone is very dangerous someone Rising the rise of a particular person is always dangerous always
16:33
aggressive so rise is always aggressive more aggressive means I need a stronger drug that is pseudamine is used that is
16:40
about trapanazoma Bruce so we were talking about trypanosomes cruzy and Bruce is done what are we left with in
16:46
this family we are left with leash Mania so what does leash Mania cause no points for guessing leishmania you will get a
16:52
question on of course kalasar and if you got a question on kala Azad there is going to be an Organo megali that they
16:58
will definitely mention and that is massive splenomegaly right if they don't
17:04
want to give you kalasar they will give you post kalasa dermales dermal involvement after kalasar so yes pkdl
17:11
could be the other thing so either they'll give you kalas are in the form of massive splenomegali or they'll give you pkdl everyone's okay with this the
17:18
media though I have already told you the media was the triple and for kalasar and cruzy for kalas are in cruisy it's going
17:24
to be triple n media but nowadays more than all these media what is the rapid antigen testing that is being done
17:30
there's rk39 antigen testing rapid car testing very very famous for for leash
17:35
Mania what do I have to know further in leash Mania what are these pictures so please remember there is something known
17:42
as LD bodies firstly LD bodies are gonna be inside some cells and what are those
17:47
cells those are macrophages so be it this or this or this these are all macrophages and how do LD bodies look
17:54
like there's gonna be a big and a small there's a big dot small dot Big Dot small dot what do I mean by that the Big
18:00
Dot is going to be the nucleus and the small dot is going to be the kinetoplast so now if you want you can zoom in and
18:07
definitely have a look you will be able to see there's a big Dot and a small dot big and small big and small everywhere
18:12
you'll see a combo you can see all other pictures that you have got you from the internet so that
18:18
you can easily identify Big Dot and small dot this is how you identify leash Mania and you know which form of leash
18:24
Mania is LD bodies that's the question that you get what is the diagnostic form the diagnostic how are you making the
18:30
diagnosis the diagnostic form is going to be the a master God form I hope that's okay quickly tell me the
18:36
treatment also this was an fmg exam question in January what is the treatment of leash Mania what is the
18:42
treatment of kalas are liposomal amphotericin B which everyone knows that about and pkdlk multifossen is a very
18:49
famous drug that you again have to know about so that is what you have for leash Mania I hope you are going good we can
18:55
move forward because now the next set of parasites that I'm gonna tell you is going to be a classical history they
19:01
will always say there is an immunocompromised patient with diarrhea and what is going to come to your mind
19:06
immunocompromise patient with diarrhea means there are three set of organisms that I will think of I'll give you a
19:12
table first and then I'll come back to this picture picture what is the table the table is the very very famous table
19:17
that we have the table is going to be off first you have to write it in an alphabetical order which means that
19:23
number one there is going to be cryptosporidium next is going to be Cyclospora next is going to be isospora
19:30
okay nowadays what they are doing instead of writing isospora they've also started calling it cysto isospora
19:36
whatever they may want to write it till the time isospora word is there I will consider it as isospora only it's the
19:43
same thing I have written it in an alphabetical order firstly I've written cryptosporidium then I've written Cy
19:49
that is Cyclospora then isospora alphabetical order so the size also goes single double triple that's how it will
19:55
go cryptosporidium is what cryptosporidium is going to be four to six microns double crochet four double
20:01
eight six double twelve so what is Cyclospora it is 8 to 12. now you'll
20:07
have to do double and triple so when I go about 12 microns double is 24 actually is 23 so for learning I have
20:14
learned 24 chalega 24 microns and if you triple it it is going to be 36 microns so simple first you start from 4 to 6
20:20
then you double the 2 so that is 8 to 12 and after 12 you double and triple so there is 24 to 36 microns what about
20:28
their shape how do you write them crypto you write with the c cycle you write with the c i so you write with an eye
20:34
just complete them this will be round in shape this will also be round in shape
20:40
but isospora comes as an eye so this is going to be oval in shape coming to the next one acid fast are all of them acid
20:47
fast yes 10 not what stain am I using let me show you the picture what stain am I using over here not just Z and
20:53
stint there's a special type of Z and stain and that is known as the cold Z and stain k for K cold Z and stain is
21:00
going to be for the kidneyon stain another name given for it is Kenyon stain so coming back yes are all of them
21:06
acid fast can you understand yes but sometimes which might not be acid fast Cyclospora how did we learn it
21:12
Cyclospora is cyclical the name only has its cyclical muscle type sometimes it is
21:18
going to be positive sometimes it is going to be negative so we call it cyclical that is how I have learned it
21:24
variable acid fast is noted who are the who are the parasites which are going to shine on their own the spora brothers
21:30
the spora Brothers Are Gonna Shine in the future okay they will shine on their own spora brother Cyclospora isospora
21:36
they Shine On on their own next what is the treatments pora Brothers Ka treatment same as pora brothers are
21:41
treated with cotrimoxazole but when I talk about cryptocurrency cryptocurrency means cryptosporidium so
21:48
who's the richest of course Nita Ambani so Nita's oxonide is the treatment for cryptocurrency that is cryptosporidium
21:55
so cryptosporidium kill Anita's oxonide whereas for Cyclospora and isospora for the spora brothers we have caught
22:01
remarks us all coming back to these pictures quickly all of them were acid fast over here yes but which is the one
22:08
which is variable acid fast means it here it is pink and then here it is not pink variable acid fast means this must
22:16
be Cyclospora then this is oval this is elongated what must this be the eye Wala
22:21
this must be isospora and then the tiniest one that you have over here this must be cryptosporidium so either you're
22:28
going to get a question on the basis of the image or they'll simply give you an HIV positive patient and that patient is
22:34
going to have diarrhea and they will give you the size of the cyst in the stool the size will be one of these and
22:40
you will have to select but what is the infective form how does the patient get it either of these if I ask you you how
22:46
is my patient going to get the infection It Is by ingestion contaminated food and water but there's one thing that happens
22:54
with raspberry cycle pay remember the one that was cycle what are you gonna buy cycle you're going to buy a very
23:00
exotic fruit called raspberry so which of them is associated with raspberry consumption remember
23:07
cycle pay everything about cycle so cycle pay you are going to go and buy raspberries cycle is going to be
23:12
cyclical sometimes it is acid fast sometimes it is not everyone's okay with this this table seems sorted we are done
23:18
with the coccidian parasites the HIV positive patient with diarrhea and one of these pictures in front of you coming
23:24
on to the next we have to now know the next set of pictures which is our very very famous malaria fever with chills
23:30
patient coming to you with fever and chills and these are the set of pictures in the blood that they will give you please note the first set of images that
23:37
I have over here is going to belong to plasmodium Y wax how do I identify plasmodium y wax please note that when
23:44
I'm talking about PV that is all of these are PV there are three forms that I see in the blood trophozoid schizont
23:51
and gametocyte tsg not tsg patha tumor suppressor tsg basically means that is
23:58
trophozoid there isn't and there is a gametrocyte how do I identify the trophozoid of Y waxy every anything is
24:04
looking one one y wax the way you write y vax it is one one one one Matlab there
24:10
is going to be one ring and there is going to be one dot one ring and one dot is seen in yvex coming
24:17
to the shy Zone shy zont is easiest to identify because it has a lot of dot dot dot mirozoid Cisco photo is very
24:23
unlikely to come now we come to the next one that is gametocyte we have a macro gamitocyte and a micro gametocyte so
24:30
macro and micromise which is the female females Co hamesha importance are that you have to give more importance to the
24:36
female so remember that macro gamitocyte is female and micro gametocyte is the male and what is their shape y wax Car
24:44
round round y wax gametocytes are all going to be round round so remember round round gamitophytes of course round
24:49
round round and how many rings one one why wax one ring one dot but now when I
24:55
come to plasmodium falciparum over here I have realized I am only seeing trophozoit and gametocyte why am I not
25:02
seeing shies on no shizont is not seen in the blood schizant is not seen in the
25:07
blood why is it not seen in the blood because it's sticking somewhere else it's in the brain can you tell me there
25:13
is going to be cerebral involvement by attaching to which receptor in the brain blood vessels which receptor does it
25:18
attach to icam1 it attaches to eye cam that is a question that there is attachment of plasmodium falciparum how
25:25
does it attach to the brain vasculature it attaches to icam1 moving on all of
25:31
you are going to tell me in the comments one thing this I'm not gonna answer I've taught you so many times on YouTube and elsewhere also that when I'm talking
25:37
about plasmodium falciferum in pathology I tell you one granuloma that you're gonna type out in the comments I'm very
25:43
confident that you know the granuloma okay coming back when I look at plasmodium falciparum in the blood I can
25:49
see now this time I'm not gonna see one one ring I'm gonna see multiple Rings lots and lots of rings are going to be
25:56
seen there are multiple rings and there are multiple dots there are too many rings too many dots so just think of too
26:03
many relatives have come into your house all of a sudden 20 30 relatives have come into your houses one of them always
26:08
going to get angry and go and sit in one corner one angry uncle and everyone's fan family same way has happened so many
26:14
rings came into this family that one ring decided that I am angry I'm gonna go and sit in one corner so what is that
26:20
ring known as that has gone and gotten attached over there that is known as the echol form or the applique form that is
26:27
known as the accol form or the applique form coming back now
26:32
trophozoids are done I don't have to worry about it coming to get me to sight gamito site is very famous for having
26:39
what kind of a shape gametrocyte is going to be banana shape now my only concern is what is male and what is
26:45
female I can't write it down for you it's something you have to visualize so look at this let's label this gametocyte
26:51
over here guys this gametocyte over here is a male how am I so confident and this one over here is a female so think of
26:59
your hostel room boys ideally it's all messy everywhere in all
27:05
everyone's messy only in their hostel but still going by what my general sense will tell me that boys are more messy
27:11
and to keep their room organized is not their cup of tea so look at the boys chromatin it's all spread out whereas
27:18
look at the female chromatin how the female has kept her chromatin nicely organized at one place so girls are
27:24
obviously a little more organized so you'll see the chromatin is nicely organized and boys are all scattered here and there all messy so no offense
27:31
to anyone because now at the end of it this is only for a mnemonic and we know that everyone's hostel room is messy
27:36
only so we've understood the plasmodium falciparum also and you know it's because it causes cerebral malaria very
27:43
very important what are we left with now I'm left with the Mala band what is mala band
27:48
now I'm left with plasmodium malaria what is plasmodium malaria plasmodium
27:53
malaria Mala because Mala band it shows you the it shows you
27:58
the band form what is band form I can see one band over here this is you'll ask me trophozoid hair gametocyte what
28:05
is it this is a trophozoid but trophozoid was supposed to look like this trophozer was supposed to look like
28:10
a ring it's not looking like a ring it's that pitch covering it's a ring which has been squeezed so instead of looking
28:16
like a ring it's looking like a pitch covering so that is what I call as band form so remember a ring which just
28:22
become became pitch cover that is a band form so Mala band is what you're gonna see for plasmodium malaria but that's
28:28
not it other than these pictures do we also see some very famous dots that you have to know which you might not get as
28:34
pictures but definitely you know either match the following questions or some kind of question will come regarding these dots and cleft so repeat we have
28:42
written the four that you have y wax falciparo malaria and oval so why wax dots how do I learn it because why why
28:49
Exam May Why by Exam May examiner always asks me questions which are all shuffled here and there not not any order
28:56
shuffling shuffling opposite m a u r m a u r tells me that
29:04
it's going to show me Morris clefts coming to z z man dot so remember again
29:10
this is Mal Mal area shows you man dots malaria shows you man dots that is also
29:16
simple and plasmodium oval how many alphabets five James how many alphabets
29:22
five so whale shows you James dots repeating why wax machine
29:29
malaria shows you Z man dots and oval five alphabets and James 5 alphabets
29:35
that is what you have to know regarding the regarding the plasmodium now the same kind of rings but suddenly I have
29:41
made it like um and lots of rings now what do you want to call it now there's not one ring I
29:47
would call it a tetrad of rings what is this known as tetrad of rings four four rings are making a cross one two three
29:54
four four rings are making a cross known as Maltese cross appearance where do you see it you see it with babeshia usually
30:00
conservala babes It Is babasia microti by Basia microti one is gonna be humans
30:06
but babasia microt is with which animal micro TV learn it as my karate my karate
30:11
means it's otherwise gonna occur between humans and rat babasia my karate is gonna be with microtic he can what is
30:18
the vector it is gonna be the Exotic tick that we study the vector is going
30:23
to be the I exoded tick that is Maltese cross very very famous picture that you
30:28
have so this set of parasites is also over can we move forward we have three families to quickly consider lots and
30:34
lots of andas coming up your way eggs that is the three methods the cystodes and the nematodes let's get going okay
30:40
so let's first start with the family of the three Matos I have a long list and a very very scary table which we're gonna
30:46
simplify in a very easy manner first you need to know the bottom line is two tables two tables and trimatodes family
30:51
I can guarantee every word of it is done so now when we talk about the trimatodes we have a long list over here let's
30:57
simplify it the definitive host for all of them shall be the human being this
31:03
person that I have drawn over here tiny this thin person over here this is the definitive host so sabka definitive host
31:10
human but only for fasciola hepatica human to hair but other than that we
31:16
also call it sheep liver fluke this is also hepaticana liver so sheep liver fluke so remember that this is gonna
31:22
actually occur in the Sheep also and sheep can also be the definitive host okay but otherwise everywhere it is
31:30
cheap first intermediate host for all of them shall be the snail for
31:37
all of them the first intermediate host is the snail so who's gonna be the game changer how will I differentiate between
31:42
them second intermediate host so let's start in a different haphazard manner clone or kiss and Opus Thor kiss from
31:49
today onwards you will call it clone or fish and Opus Thor fish clone or fish
31:55
and Opus Thor fish because the second intermediate host is fish paragonimus Western let me tell you
32:02
paragonimus para sounds like Kara para sounds like Kara so here it is gonna be
32:08
crab as the second intermediate host next you talk about f a fasciola hepatica f a fasciolopsis
32:16
Fafa will come I will have some f a coming into the story and that is fresh
32:22
aquatic vegetation it is fresh aquatic vegetation that is going to come up over
32:28
here now what am I left with I'm only left with schistosoma because schistosoma has a rule in life says
32:35
that is all that I need I am going to create an ssss in my life and I'm going
32:40
to show you so many essays over here sister Soma says I have got this nail I don't need anyone else thereafter
32:46
schistosoma does not have a second intermediate host so I hope the hosts are clear shisto Soma is only human
32:53
snail human snail shisto Soma gets Dias just so much satisfied is happy so that tells me that now in
33:00
the next table everything about schistosoma is gonna have an element of s in it means that for everyone else in
33:08
the family if you are asked what is the infective form the infective form is gonna be what the infective form is
33:15
going to be the meta circadia larva the infective form is going to be the meta
33:21
circle is not happy shisto Soma says I want siwala
33:28
larva in my life I am gonna work and have an infective form called Cirque Ria
33:33
larva next if I talk about the transmission all of them are gonna be transmitted via what all of them are
33:39
gonna be transmitted via ingestion schistosoma says no I want s my transmission is going to be by our skin
33:45
skin penetration this was the recent fmg question also which parasite has skin penetration it's in front of you so
33:52
schistosoma says skin then finally when you look at all the parasites their adult worms are
33:59
gonna be hermaphrodites their adult worms are gonna be hermaphrodites where is schistosoma says
34:06
I want us this means Sexes are gonna be separate in schistosoma which is your
34:11
previous your neat question now coming to the eggs all of them are gonna have
34:16
what kind of eggs all of them will have operculated eggs what do I understand
34:21
with operculated eggs you will see an egg which has a lid over here TK all of them have operculated eggs but shisto
34:28
Soma says no I want the S I will have eggs which have an S for spine so should we look at these eggs now once again
34:34
what are these eggs so quickly coming up over here what is the first egg shown the first egg has a lid as soon as
34:40
something has a lid I call it an upperculated egg can you tell me all the places where an upperculated egg is seen
34:46
other than trimatodes of course that entire family of course but other than trimatodes where else can you see this
34:52
so remember lid I have learned that you know mnemonic also should be something that yada exam you should be able to
34:58
recall that yeah this was the mnemonic for this topic so what is this this is an egg and it's got a lid lid is basically for a protection protection
35:05
against water you need protection against STD so what are the operculated eggs s is going to be an organism called
35:12
spirometra D is an organism known as diphylobothrium lattim and T is for all
35:18
the trimmer toads that I have just now taught you but guys any one primitone
35:24
which is running away from the family SSS so shisto so much that I'm talking about they are not going to be
35:30
operculated they are going to be spinous and what kind of spines are in front of you so now starting when
35:37
we talk about a terminal spine the terminal spine is going to be seen in schistosoma hematobium terminal tobium
35:44
hematobium terminal spine schistosoma Manson mansoni Sony Sony man sleeping
35:51
man later man tells you lateral spine and japonicum
35:57
Japan Bala that is round just it hardly has any spine I cannot see any spine it's kind of missing spineless japonicum
36:03
spineless so remember mansoni later hematobium is gonna be terminal tiwala
36:10
and Japan to spineless Wala japonicum rudimentary spine finally your table is done because now I'm gonna tell you the
36:16
drug of choice and over here finally this Monopoly that shisto Soma had created of SSS is gonna end because for
36:24
all of them the drug of choice is gonna be what Brazil yes for all of them it is
36:32
so yes for each one of them it's going to be presidential but for but for
36:39
freshiiola hepatica for fasciola hepatica it is tricla bendazole for
36:46
fasciola hepatica it is I hope that is okay with everyone so
36:52
done with this entire table two tables one table you do of the host one table you do of all the infective forms and
36:57
your trimatodes are done similarly we are going to do one table for the Sisters also we are gonna do one table
37:03
for the cystodes also so what are the cystodes Valar table now note what are the things
37:09
that I know definitive hosts so remember tinea Solium tinea sajinata
37:15
human human of course but in tenia sodium what do we have we have tinea solia markers with pigs and Saji NATA
37:23
Saji NATA is going to occur with Kata cattle okay so this is gonna occur with the cattle Saji natakas with cattle and
37:31
solia markers with pigs okay when I talk about a kinococcus granulosis this everyone knows as the very famous
37:37
hydrated cyst so yes some you know that hydrated cyst hoga that I'll see in a
37:43
while but in here human I'm gonna throw somewhere on the end because human is not just any host it is a accidental
37:50
dead end host human is accidental an accidental dead end host so what is the human the main host over here why do I
37:58
call it the dog tapeworm because dog is the definitive host I call it dog tape perm along with dog you have other
38:04
animals like sheep and wolf so remember this is primarily an animal to animal thing happening if at all it comes to us
38:10
we are coming across as an accidental dead end whose that is a kind of caucus coming to die philobotrium latinum
38:17
diphylobothrium latinum from today onwards will be learned as die fisherbothrium latinum dificiobutrium
38:24
latinum please remember dye fish two two fish there's gonna be a chotawala fish and a big fish Chota fish big fish but
38:31
humans of course have to be there so how many hosts does it have which is the only sister to have three hosts die
38:39
Philo both three or more from
38:48
now please note that two two fish the Chota fish is known as Cyclops Chota
38:53
fish is known as Cyclops and big fishes known as just fish human cyclops fish diefish coming to
39:01
etch Nana is Nano Nano means it is also known as the dwarf tape worm it is also
39:07
known as the dwarf tapeworm and also please remember that H Nana is going to have a single host human only so I
39:15
always say that you guys I was telling you this story earlier also you guys at this point of time have to be H Nana why
39:22
do I say that time come here you have 10 15 days or even less and you have to cover a lot of things so you don't have
39:28
to run for a million sources which are available in the market which will always be you have to stick to whatever
39:34
Source you were doing up till now right so you have to limit yourselves one host
39:39
only one source you have to be very very dwarf Matlab you have to be very very low profile you have to be very very
39:46
humble you don't have to be over confident because if you manage to do so God will give you success like God made
39:53
H Nana the most common sister God made it the topper so if you want to if you
40:00
want to be a Topper you have to be very very humble very very dwarf small low profile and you have to limit yourself
40:06
to one resource so try to be H Nana in life then God will give you success coming to HD Newton now that is how
40:13
microbiology is one but no diminutive not the dwarf one
40:20
diminuta is going to be occurring between humans and rat diminuta occurs between humans and rats so now simple
40:27
which is the only sister which has one host so we are all H Nana we have one source and one host which is the one
40:33
which is going to have three hosts that is going to be deal atom and all the others have two Two Hosts how do their
40:39
eggs look like I think this egg everyone already identifies that is an upperculated egg because it has a lid in
40:45
it and what was the mnemonic we had STD STD Matlab I've already told you spirometra dreamer toad family we have
40:52
done D why am I teaching you over here because it talks about D latinum diphylobothrium latinum the three three
40:58
host person that shows you an operculated egg because all the others all the other cystodes are gonna show
41:06
you this again what egg is this CIS for six sis toads you will learn as six
41:11
toads why because it is a hexacanth egg it has six hooklets
41:16
it has six hooklets that are present in the center all not only that it has these two polar knobs it has these two
41:24
polar knobs also that are going to be seen so repeating when we are talking about cystodes always pick it up by the
41:31
sixlets and that wraps up all of your pictures that you had to know for the eggs now one more thing all the eggs are
41:39
almost done if you do the eggs of the nematode family also so why don't we do the round worm hookworm and all the
41:44
nematodes also and finish off the eggs sounds like a good deal so when I'm talking about round round eggs now
41:50
starting with nematode families talking about the round round egg or ascaris that is going to be round worm but as
41:56
carrots has two types of eggs fertilized and non-fertilized very easy to learn fertilized it has no no Vala word in it
42:04
non-fertilized has no Vala word in it so who is going to say a yes to everything fertilized egg will say a yes to
42:11
everything non-fertilized egg no health or non-fertilizer no no no to everything means what if I ask you which of these
42:18
has a thick albumin coat thick albumin court is present in the fertilized egg fertilizer has to say yes
42:25
yes yes non-fertilizer will say no no no so non-fertilized next we talk about which of them has a space a crescentric
42:32
space so yes again who will say the yes fertilized egg will have the space and
42:37
non-fertilized egg will not have the space finally coming to who is going to float on saturated salt solution
42:43
flotation who is going to float corn yes tiger fertilize will say yes non-fertilized will not say yes simple
42:49
everything yes yes for fertilize no no for non-fertilized coming to the next one the next one is the Egg of trichuris
42:56
tricura how do we identify this trichurist trickura egg we are going to look at the shape of the eggs look at
43:03
this some people call it a dholak but it's actually a barrel shaped egg it's a barrel shaped egg and what are you gonna
43:09
do after drawing this like you have a bomb nut you see in those Bollywood movies you have a bomb and excited
43:16
there are actually mucous plugs there are going to be mucus plugs that are scene and please note I have drawn those
43:23
plugs as T and T because that will remind you again with the mucus plugs that is going to be T and T that is
43:30
trichurist tricura coming to the next the egg which actually has little bit of
43:35
hooking happening it's not a complete round can you see those depressions it has those hook kind of things happening
43:43
that happens to be our hook worming stoma hookworm and finally the egg which
43:49
looks like a d d Matlab why did I say d like that because D shape
43:55
[Music] vermicularis we are talking about enterobius
44:02
vermicularis I hope everyone's okay with this enterobius vermicularis basically means which part of the intestine we are
44:08
talking about vermi form appendix is gonna sit now there's a very
44:15
important question where are all these seen these are seen in Diary of Allah samples but which of them might not be
44:21
seen in this tool sample that is going to be enterobius enterobius might not be seen
44:27
in the stool sample why because enterobe is vermicularis very commonly tends to
44:32
go and sit in the perianal region that is why the patient usually presents with
44:37
perianal pruritis he will always come to you with a history of itching in the perianal region so this eggs are not
44:43
coming out in the diary are the eggs are sticking in that perineal region how do I pick them up from this periennial
44:49
region if it's a Bacha you can stick a tape and pick it up so what do you call this you call it the Scotch tape method
44:55
if it's an adult you can pick it up with the help of a swab and the swab is referred to as the NIH swab swab is
45:02
known as the NIH swap so either the Scotch tape method or the NIH swab method that wraps up your nematodex also
45:09
but the nematode family is not over because there is one family or one part of nematodes which doesn't lay eggs it
45:14
has all the micro file area yes it has all the larva forms so what is that family known as the filarial nematodes
45:21
that is exactly and you know what question you're gonna get for the 5 nematodes you will get what is the tail
45:27
looking like okay so now I've got six organisms super
45:32
super tough part and we are gonna make it super super easy trust me and trust me on that after this you will never
45:38
ever get this wrong center may you make a line like this I'm
45:43
gonna divide them into two categories this category is going to have the sheath these are the sheath larva that
45:49
we have and these are the ones which are gonna be unsheathed right these are the unsheathed larva that we are talking
45:56
about so how do I learn them through yadracho lbw lbw is gonna be sheathed
46:01
lbws so that is how we've learned it lbws means what remember L for lower
46:07
lower [Music]
46:38
these are always already going to be the
46:45
now the next question that you'll get is on the nucleus so what do you have to know over there remember that booster
46:51
area will it have nuclei coming to the end no it does not butcher area
46:56
absent so that is how we have to make such funny funny things and learn it because otherwise how should we learn
47:01
such a volatile things when I say whoosh whoosh is that con you
47:06
know that effect that they used to use when they wanted someone to disappear the nuclei are gonna be absent okay now
47:13
when I talk about how many nuclei will be present at the tip there are two nuclei that are gonna
47:20
be present at the tip simple there is two by brugya lower LL line say nuclei
47:27
line of nuclei line of nuclei are gonna be present at
47:32
the tip so simple now which of them doesn't have nuclei at the tip washer area may buy two nucleus
47:40
now we come to the unsheathed one so all the unsheathed ones are they will ask you which has a nucleus and which does
47:47
not persistent word is coming mansonella persons persons Matlab the nuclei are
47:53
persisting till the tip the nuclei are gonna be present till the tape
47:58
the other ones are not having persistent words nuclei are not gonna be at the tip
48:04
now is this table becoming easy can you give a test for me look at this now
48:09
first what do you see first you have to see sheets there do you see one covering one nice pinkish covering so definitely
48:16
it is sheathed guys if it is sheathed then what do you think of you have to think of lbws
48:22
now I start looking at the The Head and the tip so now I realize can you see anything over here I can see the sheath
48:29
definitely the sheath is there but tell me is the nucleus coming till the tip is
48:35
the nucleus coming till the tip over here no it is not I can see an empty space over here to whoosh absent
48:43
this must be a case of butcher area ban crafty I hope that is okay with
48:50
everyone yes everyone's got it and you know how are these patients gonna present here in front of you the patient
48:56
is gonna present with elephant elephantiases the lymphatic drainage is
49:01
affected elephantiases and what is this appearance of the urine known as the appearance of the urine is known as Kyle
49:07
urea very very important pictures for bushid area Bancroft the elephantiases and chyluria sorted finally with that
49:14
our section of the parasitology has come to an end and now we are ready to take it up in terms of bacteriology lots of
49:21
bacterias and let's go in for the next 45-50 minutes and let's talk about all the bacterias that are important
49:28
so now starting with the next segment of bacteriology so you all know we are going to start with the kokai and the
49:33
general rule that everyone is aware of that all the kokai are going to be gram positive except which three guys except
49:40
which are the ones which are not gram positive and that include Velo Nella
49:46
moraxella and niceria these are the ones which are
49:51
not gram positive means the Venom the venom venom is always poisonous so it always is different from the other so
49:58
all the kokaya gram positive but the venomous ones that is velonella marxella
50:04
as well as niceria these are the gram negative cocai so first I'm starting with the gram positive ones what are the
50:11
images that for gram positive you have to know the most famous defylococcus Aureus and when I'm talking about
50:16
staphylococcus aureus I can definitely see there is a very very famous grape like what is the meaning of the words to
50:22
files to file word means grape-like clusters so let's have a look at all these pictures we are gonna see the
50:27
presence of grape like clusters because that is the meaning of the word staphile other than that I call it staphylococcus
50:34
aureus because the meaning of the word a u means golden golden it produces a golden color pigment so staphyle is
50:40
grape a u is golden what is the hemolysis that you see you see a narrow zone of hemolysis if you look at this
50:46
picture there's a very very tiny layering around it that you see there's a very narrow narrow zone of
50:52
hemolysis that is noted finally coming to the last one the last one is going to be catalase how do I identify Catalyst
50:59
test whenever I'll see bubbles in any test bubbles Catalyst test that is something that you have to have to know
51:06
so catalysters bubbly test should we devise all the cattle is positive organisms first yes so the simple rule
51:12
is that cats are very very bubbly cats are very bubbly they keep running around from one place to another and other cats
51:18
are very bubbly so I need a lot of space for them otherwise cat cannot sit at one place so cats are very very bubbly so
51:24
catalase is Bubbles and they are gonna move around a lot so that is space being made space being made Muslim now let's
51:31
start learning now the problem in the exam is not the same so it's being made you will run but what was s what was a b
51:37
c d all that goes for a toss and we've all been through that phase so we know that mnemonics are also just for the sake of saying it's easy sometimes it
51:44
can be quite a task to learn mnemonic so we learn it in a way that we'll be able to recall it in the paper also you know
51:49
so now first when I talk about s and B the SP I'm gonna take up the pigments of
51:56
all the bacterias possible so tell me for assistophylococcus to philococcus
52:01
audio says what pigment golden next s is serratia ceratia has what pigmented red
52:07
so Asia has red pseudomonas I don't need any mnemonic everyone knows it has a blue green pigment so the first three
52:14
that I've taken up are staff sericia pseudomonas pigment while organisms next two that I'm gonna take up a and C these
52:22
are going to be all your fungal organisms what are the fungal organisms that we have to know of so the next
52:28
three fungal organisms are ACC aspergillus candida and cryptococcus that is also Catalyst positive the next
52:35
alphabet is e e is I'm going to take an entire family enterobacteracia family
52:40
that is E coli enterobacteracia enterobacter these are going to be Catalyst positive then space being made
52:46
so B is what the deadly deadly bacillus anthrosis the super deadly bacillus
52:51
anthrosis is is going to be Catalyst positive and finally we have space being
52:57
made M for what is very famous in our country that is mycobacterium TB if you can learn micrococcus very good
53:03
otherwise are not a problem so the main ones first you take up staff serration pseudomonas pigment Walla then you take
53:10
aspergillus candida crypto that is the fungal e for E coli enterobacter deadly one bacillus anthrosis commonweala
53:16
mycobacterium TB all of them are bubbly bubbly Catalyst positive why I spoke about it over here because staph aureus
53:22
is also Catalyst positive is there any other enzyme that Sapphire is is positive of other than catalase it is
53:28
also coagula is positive it is also coagulous positive but what is the selective media what is the selective
53:35
media we have something called Mannitol salt agar first and foremost why am I calling it a selective media because it
53:41
is selectively growing staph aureus it has salt salt makes it selective next
53:47
this is also a differential media why is it a differential media because it contains Mannitol manitol fermentation
53:54
versus non-mannitol fermentation is it telling me a difference yes so if it's telling me a difference it's a
54:00
differential media and what do you see when Mannitol is fermented what color have I got I've got a yellow color
54:06
manitol fermentation by staph aureus gives it a yellow color but color change Matlab there must have been some
54:11
indicator there is definitely an indicator that we have so is this an indicator media also yes and what is the
54:18
indicator previous year question what is the indicator of mannitol saltagar it is phenol red repeating once again this
54:25
medium is a selective plus differential plus indicator media selective because it has salt selectively grow stuff
54:31
differential because it tells me the difference between Mannitol and non-mannatal ferment as an indicator because it has an indicator called
54:38
phenol red now guys please note I'm gonna tell you lots of fermentations today in the
54:44
next 40 minutes I'm again and again talking talking about a lot of fermentation every fermentation is going to give me a
54:51
yellow color till the time I don't tell you an exception every fermentation Mannitol fermentation yellow lactose
54:56
fermentation yellow sucrose fermentation yellow till the time I will not tell you an exception everything is going to be
55:01
yellow yellow okay so now staff is done obviously the next organism that we are going to talk about is streptococcus so
55:07
the first question coming in the exam is how do you classify streptococcus so streptococcus is classified into Alpha
55:13
hemolytic beta hemolytic and Gamma hemolytic how will I identify their pictures Alpha hemolysis is gonna give a
55:19
greenish color beta hemolysis is gonna give a yellow color and Gamma hemolysis
55:24
is gone there is no hemolysis that happens so Alpha the way you write alpha alpha G
55:31
inside it what is the color that I'll go I'm gonna get an alpha hemolysis I'll get a green color beta I can make a
55:38
yellow what is the color color that I'll get with beta hemolysis yellow color and Gamma is gone there is no breakage at
55:44
all so should we do the organisms of course when I'm talking about Alpha hemolysis
55:50
that is the green color we have VP organisms under it VP organism matlabs
55:56
streptococcus viridins versus streptococcus pneumonia see the way I use the word did I say ideas
56:02
I've emphasized on that R viridins is very very resistant veridines means it
56:08
doesn't say a yes to anything you give it any property it'll say no no no and streptococcus pneumonia is very very
56:15
nice very nice you give it any property it will say yes what do I mean by that means I'm gonna talk about a property
56:22
called bio biodata biodata what do I mean by biodata because if the biodata
56:28
will be good I will get the pitch the person will get a job so now I have to see which candidate will you select the
56:34
candidate who always says yes will you select that candidate or the candidate who always says no will you select him
56:39
obviously so think of your hod now think now forget all this neat PG and all let's think of good days You're Gonna
56:45
become a first year resident sometimes how many months later but you're gonna become a first year resident and then
56:50
you'll have an hod and you have to do your thesis under your hod so whatever the hod says your answer has to be a yes
56:56
whether you like it or you don't harsh reality but your answer is gonna be yes so who is going to have a chill life in
57:02
the department someone who always says yes to the hod who will have a license to relax and play games that is the
57:10
story so listen to me when I ask you bile solubility who will say yes to biosolubility pneumonia is nice
57:17
pneumonia will say yes yes I am bile soluble next I for inulin fermentation who will show you a new information
57:23
pneumonia will show you in your information who will show you optogen sensitivity pneumonia will show you
57:28
operation sensitivity this means viridians is everything no no bile solubility optogen sensitivity inulin
57:37
fermentation is everything no no no and pneumonia everything yes yes biodata yes biodata
57:43
yes F saying yes to the hod this means this pneumonia is going to to get a license license to play games and not
57:51
work so what games is he playing he is playing Karim so remember he's gonna get
57:56
a license Matlab lanciolet shape lens shape organism and he's gonna play carom
58:01
now he he said yes to the hod so he's hod's favorite he's gonna play Karim what kind of colonies do we get we get
58:07
the carom coin or the drotsman colonies we get the carom coin or the
58:13
colonies that is what you have to know I hope it's okay with everyone's streptococcus viridins versus pneumonia
58:19
and who is going to get the license to play carob in the department
58:24
so that is the story of alpha hemolytics streptococcus now let's go on to the story of beta hemolytics streptococcus
58:31
before that there's a very famous classification that I have which is known as the landsfield classification
58:36
and I hope all of you remember that landsfield because I have I written because landsfield
58:43
classification is gonna be what yes yes C4 carbohydrate antigen they will ask
58:48
you what is the basis of the landsfield classification it is c for carbohydrate antigen on the basis of that we have
58:54
divided it into group a b c d like that so what is group a beta hemolytics
58:59
streptococcus what is group a beta hemolytics streptococcus it is
59:06
streptococcus biogenes kapura mnemonic heat streptococcus biogenes you will say so many things are written over here not
59:21
what do I mean by that if I ask you what is the transport media
59:26
what is the transport Media One pie is gonna come in your life that is Pikes media so transport media
59:33
Pikes coming to the next when I'm talking about what kind of colonies you will say Pi Pine Point colonies fine
59:40
point colonies when I say what zone of hemolysis why wide zone of hemolysis wide zone of
59:47
hemolysis so repeating Pi Pi y Pi for Pio genes Pi for pi x media Pi for Pine
59:53
Point colonies y for white zone of hemolysis after that you're gonna write
59:58
streptococcus pyogenes once over here and streptococcus biogenes once over here why because if I ask you who is
1:00:04
Bacitracin sensitive you will say yeah if to Bacitracin it is sensitive if I ask you any other test that it is
1:00:11
positive you will say yes it is pyr test positive so repeating s pyogenes s for
1:00:17
Bacitracin sensitive Pi for pyr test positive so this is okay with the biochemical test now we come to the next
1:00:23
that is going to be the selective media when I talk about the selective media again streptococcus biogenes is your
1:00:28
mnemonic so the p over here is going to tell me the P that is the PNF media the
1:00:33
Y over here is going to tell me the V that is the crystal Violet blood agar very few have Crystal Violet in their
1:00:41
blood agar as the selective media Crystal Violet blood agar and on some liquid media can you get turbidity oh
1:00:48
may I have shown you granular turbidity they call it is so simple when I talk about streptococcus biogenes the p is
1:00:54
going to be for PNF media the V is Crystal Violet blood agar and you're gonna get granular turbidity on
1:01:00
biochemical you can see that this is bacitrus insensitive it is pyr test positive and medium is of course Pi Pi
1:01:06
Pi y you are sorted I told you it's very very simple to do streptococcus biogenes because now this
1:01:13
was group a I am going to go towards Group B beta hemolytic streptococcus what is Group B beta hemolytic
1:01:19
streptococcus it is streptococcus and what is the famous tests that you do
1:01:24
for streptococcus it is going to be the it is going to be the camp test right so
1:01:31
Camp test just say hebola your mind took you towards reverse Camp test reverse cam test is done for clostridium per
1:01:38
fringes let's do a repeat of this now how will I identify because both of them look the same they could either be blood
1:01:44
agree then you will see the horizontal labeling this is also streptococcus
1:01:50
agility and this is also gonna be streptococcus agility How will I know which is Camp and which is reverse Camp
1:01:56
I have to look at this line in the center this is the line which is going to be differentiating if I've used the
1:02:02
usual Vala bacteria staphylococcus aureus this means my focus is staph aureus is such a common bacteria my
1:02:08
focus is not on staphonous my focus will then go to streptococcus what am I doing this for Camp test is for the diagnosis
1:02:15
of what then I'll give importance to streptococcus agility but along with streptococcus agility if over here
1:02:22
clostridium perforingence is mentioned then I will give importance to clostridium perfringence it's a reverse
1:02:28
scam test I am doing this for the diagnosis of clostridium performance so please remember both of them will have
1:02:34
streptococcus aggylacterial but the streptococcus agility is the main unusual Vala bacteria so then it is a
1:02:40
camp test if there is some other bacteria which is even more famous than streptococcus agility like clostridium
1:02:46
perfringens then you're going to call it a reverse Camp test easy yes every
1:02:51
confusion sorted Group B beta hemolytic done so basically we are just left with this gamma what is going to come under
1:02:57
this gamma this gamma is going to include enterococcus and enterococcus related what simple question everything
1:03:03
about enterococcus is going to be BBB means enterococcus looks like abena enterococcus question Change karoto is
1:03:11
Gonna look like a it's going to look like a b so first and foremost the shape is going to be like a spectacle the
1:03:17
shape of this bacteria is going to be like a spectacle after that it can grow in 40 percent bile it can grow in 40
1:03:24
bile so it is going to grow in bile this means when when you're using a media you
1:03:30
are going to use a bile escalin azide agar you don't have to know the full form at least learn something bilewala
1:03:36
media media hoga and I'm gonna get what color for enterococcus I'm going to get
1:03:41
a black color so here over guys over here you are going to get a black color this means enterococcus had grown here
1:03:48
you did not get [Music]
1:03:56
it can grow so I use that ability I used a media called the bile Escalon as idagar and the color that I got was a
1:04:02
black color and I think everyone knows the treatment that we start off with penicillins
1:04:08
penicillin resistance we start off with Vancomycin also and nowadays we also have Vancomycin resistance for midline
1:04:15
isolate is also given so that is the treatment for pharmacology that you guys already know clear shall we move on yeah
1:04:22
now let's go into a little bit of Basil iron what is this firstly let me show you the entire Spectrum now you guys
1:04:28
have seen the labeling I know you analyzed and these are like celebrity questions you've seen the same pictures
1:04:34
over and over and over again total celebrity questions what am I talking about I am talking about a case of
1:04:40
qurani bacterium diphtheria what are the celebrity people that I have over here this child with a pseudo membrane on the
1:04:47
palate and this child with a bull's neck the Bull's neck Matlab yeah this patient is gonna have multiple lymphadenopathies
1:04:53
so lots of lymph nodes and lots of pseudo membranes
1:05:00
membrane is dead material membrane is all necrotic material so where are you going to take the sample from under the
1:05:06
membrane you will take the sample not from the the membrane from under the membrane you took the sample and you got
1:05:12
this very very famous appearance what is this known as it's looking like VL and different different Chinese leather
1:05:18
appearances so this is the Chinese letter appearance that you had so this is a usual Gram stain but now I
1:05:25
realize that when I put some other stain they have a lot of granules in it what are the names Pele to learn the names of
1:05:30
these granules you will actually realize that there are these organisms and there are granules like this which are at the
1:05:36
poles the poles bipolar granules they're also known as metachromatic granules
1:05:41
then they have no fancy fancy Nam volutin granules and babes earns granules okay so what are volutin and
1:05:48
babes Ernst and metachromatic and bipolar whatever you may want to call it what are they going to contain energy
1:05:54
poly metaphosphate they contain polymetaphosphate they are a chunk of
1:06:00
energy that this bacteria has now I understand why the bacteria loves this so much and why the examiner also loves
1:06:05
this so much energy conservative this is an energy storing place so now the examiner will ask me now the examiner is
1:06:13
going to ask me what are the stains that you have for these volutin granules can we pick up the stains for these volutin
1:06:19
granules very very famous questions the stains are gonna be plant stains
1:06:25
what is your plan to stay in them yes my plan to stain them is P for Ponder stain
1:06:31
a for Albert stain and for knee surgery in fact the picture
1:06:37
given over here is Albert staining the picture that you have over here is the Albert staining and you can see there's
1:06:43
a green color bacteria and there are these blue color granules so this is Albert staining that has been given but
1:06:50
nowadays they are saying which is the best stain that we have we have law
1:06:55
Fleur methylene blue as the best stain law Fleur methylene blue is going to be
1:07:00
the best tail so repeating what is your plan to stay in the volutin granules Ponder loflur Albert Nissa this is this
1:07:07
is your plan and that's gonna be for karani bacterium diphtheria but the story is not over because you've only done staining what about the culture
1:07:14
media so here we have with the culture media so whenever they're talking about karani bacterium diphtheria they will
1:07:20
ask you two questions number one is gonna be the enriched media number two is gonna be the
1:07:26
selective media so when I talk about enriched count the alphabets one two three four five six seven eight you'll
1:07:32
be like what the hell man what are you making us do exam time here you're making us do mathematics as a counting time waste no it's very very helpful so
1:07:40
we are gonna do LaFleur law Fleur also has eight alphabets again you can do time waste eight count Kara Q because it
1:07:46
takes six to eight hours to grow on a loftler serum slope the enriched media which has eight alphabets is gonna have
1:07:53
loffler as the example which are eight alphabet and eight hours is what it's gonna take to grow so this is for fast
1:07:58
diagnosis but when they talk about selective we have potassium Telluride agar and this is the picture black color
1:08:04
picture given for potassium Telluride agar which takes a good 48 hours so
1:08:10
please read the question carefully if they say there's a case of qurani bacterium diphtheria and they want early diagnosis early diagnosis you're gonna
1:08:18
go in for enriched but if they want a diagnosis which is the best media best will always be selective that is
1:08:24
potassium tell you right agar finally they say you're talking about qurani bacterium diphtheria some of them will
1:08:30
have a toxin some of them will not have a toxin so if you want to know whether the toxin is present or absent what is
1:08:38
the test that you will be doing I will be doing the LX gel precipitation test I
1:08:44
will do the LX gel precipitation test which is going to tell me whether toxin is there or not there and how do I
1:08:50
analyze that rocket science I know all of you are very very scared of these precipitant
1:08:55
reactions very simple it is guys just note it's an antigen antibody reaction so if antigen and antibody will react
1:09:02
lines will be seen so simple if an antigen and an antibody
1:09:07
are reacting reaction line hoga the line is going to be seen
1:09:12
and if the antigen and antibody are not there then the reaction will not be seen so they colline is seen Matlab toxin was
1:09:19
there line is seen line is seen wherever lines are seen this means toxin was there these were what these were
1:09:25
toxogenic these were toxogenic whereas over here in the last one do you see any line anywhere in this region any
1:09:31
precipitant line no means this was non-toxigenic this was non-toxigenic so I hope that's okay with everyone so LX
1:09:38
Del precipitation simple line is there toxin is there line
1:09:44
is not there toxin is not there no rocket science only the name that you have to know the toxin is tested by the
1:09:50
LX gel precipitation testing okay so now the next set of organisms that I have
1:09:55
for all of you is this you know I have four forming organisms then as soon as I say Spore forming organisms bacillus and
1:10:02
clostridium comes to your mind is
1:10:10
of five flash cards and we are done with the story when I'm talking about sports
1:10:16
firstly Sports have not taken a color because sports are gonna be grand poor they are not gonna take any gram
1:10:21
positive gram negative you'll see them as kalikali sports are not gonna take up any color so next question what is the
1:10:27
most common location before the terminal ending it is subterminal most common is subterminal but then they will ask you
1:10:34
where are the terminal right at the end at the end for terminal t e for clostridium I
1:10:42
tetani will be terminal te for clostridium tercium tercium is also
1:10:47
gonna be terminal simple now t e for terminal t e for tetna t for tertium but then the confusion is
1:10:58
known as the drumstick appearance and tertia Matlab is going to be the tennis
1:11:04
racket appearance now again in the exam students forget cat 10s racket cat drumstick so they go though then God has
1:11:11
given the name only as such t e r t e r will tell me that yeah that is the tennis racket appearance and clostridium
1:11:17
tetna is the drumstick appearance so they could now look at these pictures if I zoom in you can very well see this one
1:11:23
is looking like a drumstick round here this one is looking like a drumstick and this is oval so this is looking like the
1:11:29
tennis racket so yeah Huga and this must be
1:11:43
serious is gonna show me Central Sports also there's an organism called clostridium by fermentins if you can
1:11:50
learn it very good as a quick question but yes buy for maintenance which tells you that is also Central so repeating c
1:11:57
e for Central c e for serious and then t e and t e made tetanitors for terminal
1:12:02
rest everything becomes sub terminal one thing I'll finish off here only can you all tell me this basil is serious
1:12:09
there is a Chinese fried rice consumption there is a Chinese fried
1:12:14
rice consumption say food poisoning and that food poisoning usually tends to occur within six hours it's a short
1:12:20
incubation food poisoning very very famous bacillus area serious for C4 C is
1:12:26
how we learned it seriously Ce Central is
1:12:31
Central Chinese food and that is how you have the food poisoning let's talk about
1:12:36
the others the first one that I'm starting with is actually going to be the bacillus Anthrax for all of those
1:12:41
who were a part of the live session yesterday all of you know what is the scare that I have at this point of time
1:12:47
because this was the Jinx where our session just got disrupted and never came back but yeah I hope fingers
1:12:52
crossed the Jinx is not there in this session so what do I have over here this is a case of bacillus Anthrax and let's
1:12:57
look at all the pictures that bacillus Anthrax will show you also this was a recent fmg exam question in January so
1:13:03
here firstly when I'm talking about bacillus Anthrax or bacillus anthraces I
1:13:09
know it's a deadly organism deadly not only for the YouTube live sessions but also deadly because it's a bioterrorism
1:13:15
a agent and now it's going to show me firstly what malignant texture there is nothing malignant about it only the
1:13:21
appearance is a little scary it's necrotic black hemorrhagic it's looking a little scary otherwise
1:13:27
it's not malignant it's no cancer okay so patient has malignant gesture after that now let's start now the way you
1:13:33
write DNA bacillus anthrosis you are gonna write BNA patient has bamboo stick appearance on a Gram stain so now the
1:13:40
question that came in the fmg exam instead of bamboo stick they called it boxcar appearance so bamboo stick Matlab
1:13:46
like this like they zoom in and see you can see the bamboo stick but can you see a hole in the center what is that hole
1:13:52
that did not take up the Gram stain common sense that must have been the Spore henna so this pore area was there
1:13:58
and then the bamboo stick or the boxcar appearance is there next when you look at it on a nutrient agar you have the
1:14:04
very famous Medusa head appearance this is the baby where we have which all of us are going to have at the end of
1:14:10
the session with so much of information overload to all hair gonna go up electric shock the Medusa head
1:14:15
appearance finally we come to what there is a string of Pearl's appearance PE Matlab pearls and cons
1:14:21
I'm Gonna Get It On A penicillinagar String of Pearl's appearance is going to
1:14:27
be seen on a penicillin a guard you can see this beautiful String of Pearls formed over here finally I look at the
1:14:33
patient and I take his sample and I put it in a gelatin stab gelatin stab me I got an inverted for tree appearance
1:14:40
gelatin stab I gotten inverted fur tree appearance because now they will also ask you
1:14:47
opposite
1:14:52
tree has also fallen off Ultra tree but when I'm talking about clostridium tetnae tetna shows you a tree a property
1:15:00
means it's gonna show you a fur tree appearance simple now so remember bacillus anthra says super super deadly
1:15:06
bye [Music]
1:15:15
on that note we are done with bacillus anthritis so the bacillus story is done now I can go to the clostridium since I
1:15:21
was talking about clostridium let us let me start with clostridium Techni when I say clostridium tetani I know for a fact
1:15:27
that you will be asked a question that when you are talking about clostridium tetnae what is the patient having the
1:15:34
patient is having muscle spasms the patient is having muscle spasm so this condition that the patient is
1:15:40
having is that because of what what are the two toxins let me ask you this first toxin there are two toxins that you have
1:15:47
one is gonna be tetanu look at how I'm writing it one is going to be tet no license and one is going to be
1:15:55
tetnospasmin techno spasmin and very very simple techno lies in my ol hair so
1:16:01
this is oxygen labile and technospasmin may OS hair so this is oxygen state table and that is one question that they
1:16:08
ask you which is oxygen labile which is oxygen stable but what is tetanus famous for tetanus is famous for causing spasms
1:16:15
of the muscle so who is gonna cause who is the pathogenic toxin technospasmin is the pathogenic toxin so yes how does it
1:16:22
cause the action it is going to cause an inhibition at which level we all know this it causes a pre-synaptic inhibition
1:16:29
and what is there a decrease in which one or which mediators are going to be decreased Gaba and glycine are going to
1:16:36
be decreased there is a pre-synaptic inhibition that has happened so coming back now basically there are spasms but
1:16:42
the first and the most common to occur is the lock jaw why does that happen konsawala muscle involveda log jaw means
1:16:48
the masseter muscle has been affected but the pictures that I've shown you over here are complications what is this
1:16:54
complication known as it looks like the patient is smiling but actually he's not it is Rice's sardonicus second is going
1:17:01
to be he's not smiling he's not happy tetanus is deadly grave disease not gonna smile but why is he looking as if
1:17:06
he's smiling because all these facial muscles have contracted Togo contract towards creating a pull so patient is
1:17:12
smiling now next we have something I'm not going to show you the Rice's artonic as I remember I was doing it in
1:17:18
one of the Plus classes once upon a time and uh what did the you know the students then took a screenshot and put
1:17:25
it up on social media so I was looking like a Rice's sardonicus patient so yeah you guys do nasty things at times coming
1:17:31
to the next complication the next one is the bow shape appearance that it has that is the epistotonous
1:17:37
is the next complication so Rices sardonicus and epistotonus is what you see this picture you already know I've
1:17:44
already told you clostridium tetna is gonna have what kind of uh an appearance terminals
1:17:50
terminals that part of it we have anywhere
1:17:56
talking about the next what is this media see remember all the clostridia
1:18:01
they are gonna be anaerobic organisms when I say anaerobic organisms by default it means that the media that I
1:18:08
will be using will be the Robertsons cooked meat broth so it's we are gonna have the Robertsons cooked
1:18:15
meat about finally what motility this round and round and round concentric motility that is referred to as
1:18:21
the swarming motility so where else in microbiology do you see the famous
1:18:27
famous swarming motility jaldi say let us make a quick revision swarming means these concentric as around and round and
1:18:34
round and that is seen with PVCs PVCs means what the sea I have already told you clostridium tetnae in fact when
1:18:41
bacillus C Vala bacillus can also show you that a basil is serious these are the two but the main organism which
1:18:48
actually shows you is going to be Proteus the main organism is actually going to be protist that is important
1:18:53
and the next one is going to be vibrio but not vibrio cholera VP vibrio para
1:18:58
hemolyticus vibrio para hemolyticus also shows you swarming and finally cerecia
1:19:04
also shows you swarming repeating Proteus vibrio conservala VP vibrio para
1:19:09
hemolyticus clostridium tetnae and serious bacillusarius and finally we have ceratia that is going to be the
1:19:16
swarming motility that we are talking about so clostridium so we are done with
1:19:21
done with the toxins that is done now we're gonna move on to the next one can you identify the disease as soon as I
1:19:28
say clostridium perfringence what is the disease that's going to occur it's going to be gas gangrene the disease that I'm
1:19:34
talking about is the gas gangrene and now what is the gas how will the examiner want to tell me gangrene to all
1:19:40
gangrene tissues are black Black dead dry gangrene wet gangrene gas there are
1:19:47
gonna be crackles and crepitus crackles and crepitus is what the examiner is gonna tell me so that is sorted now this
1:19:54
clostridium perforingence is very famous for a mnemonic called senior NTR very
1:20:00
very famous what is senior NTR s is for stormy clot formation stormy clot
1:20:06
formation you can see the litmus milk test and you can all see the stormy clot that is formed on top so number one it
1:20:12
shows you stormy clot formation next NTR n for neglers reaction neglers reaction
1:20:19
we had to take a negler plate wow no one's going to ask you that negular plate negler plate is going to be
1:20:26
something that has egg yolk egg yolk egg yolk is very very rich and less a thin
1:20:31
still doesn't make sense why am I taking egg yolk why am I taking lecithin because clostridium perfringence has an
1:20:38
alpha Toxin and those Alpha toxin covers the other name for Alpha toxin which has
1:20:45
been asked in the previous year questions is lecithinase to Alpha toxin
1:20:50
is lesser thinnies it's gonna break the lecithin and that is why you're getting this kind of a reaction over here this
1:20:56
means there was Alpha toxin present if you get that opaque area that is negler's reaction coming to NTR t for
1:21:03
what T for Target hemolysis Target hemolysis means double zone of hemolysis so yes Target hemolysis or double zone
1:21:09
of hemolysis is also noted and the last one I have already shown you earlier also guys reverse Camp test positive
1:21:16
parathana where did you study Camp test cam test was streptococcus
1:21:21
marked and over here clostridium perforingen says Mark then you will be marking it as reverse cam test I hope
1:21:28
everyone remember there should not be any confusion what are you going to give to the patient see clostridium yes
1:21:37
hyperbaric oxygen the first thing that you'll have to think of is giving oxygen out here and other than that obviously
1:21:43
surgical debridement has to be done with antibiotics surgical debridement of this dead dead tissue you will have to remove
1:21:49
you will have to make the patient uh run on antibiotics and you will have to give oxygen that is important and this is
1:21:55
like Common Sense while our treatment which is coming to my mind so clostridium perforations done clostridium tetanite and the last one
1:22:01
that I'm left with is clostridium difficile which causes what it causes pseudomembranous enterocolitis there are
1:22:07
two three standard questions saturation no one's going to ask you anything beyond that
1:22:12
when I talk about pseudomembranous enterocolitis the first question is that there is a long-term use of antibiotics
1:22:19
there is a long-term use of antibiotics that the patient will be on after that
1:22:24
long-term use of antibiotics my patient has started coming to me with watery diarrhea now when the patient comes to
1:22:30
me with diarrhea and there's a long-term use of antibiotics I decided that I'm going to do a colonoscopy on doing a
1:22:36
colonoscopy I saw this really dirty dirty dirty pseudo membrane on which part of the intestine that's the
1:22:42
question that is why I'm doing a colonoscopy to see through it I see it on the mucosa why are you seeing it on a
1:22:48
mucosa because there has been a volcano eruption that has happened in the intestine what do you see microscopically we see the volcano
1:22:55
eruption condition in the intestine they don't get confused I don't know why this is a confusion but it is I really don't
1:23:02
know the source of this confusion but remember in the exam if this inward flask comes or this outward lava comes
1:23:10
people get confused I really don't understand why they
1:23:17
here you are seeing that outward Expo explosion like a lava bursting volcano
1:23:22
eruption that is what you'll see with Clostridium difficile so I hope there is no confusion now
1:23:28
so now how will you treat it clause or sorry how will you go ahead with the diagnosis what culture media class
1:23:34
tritium difficult
1:23:42
in containing media so remember Clostridium difficile ccfaccyr is how
1:23:48
you are going to learn it on that note how are you going to treat it of course all of you want to say vancomycin and
1:23:56
Metro gel metronidazole but is there anything else also which is uh important
1:24:01
now for the milder forms of the disease so remember fidaxomycin for the milder diseases
1:24:08
fidaxomycin is a new drug that has been told and of course you have to stop the long-term usage of antibiotics that the
1:24:14
patient is doing that goes without any say for milder diseases fedaxomycin and otherwise vancomycin and metrogel also
1:24:21
is important done with all the clostridium and bacillus should we move on to one more family the next family is
1:24:26
going to be another set of fermenters which is in front of you and that is going to be the lactose fermenters now
1:24:31
when I'm talking about the lactose fermento and other lactose fermented media I have one is meconkey one is okay
1:24:39
so first let me do that composition McConkey is made up of a pretty pink plant I say McConkey is a pretty pink
1:24:45
plant why do I say pretty pink plant because firstly when lactose is being fermented I'm getting a pink color and
1:24:51
pink plant Matlab plant is going to be what all does it contain any agar on
1:24:57
this planet will obviously have agar in it wow next it's also going to have peptone in it so these are like Common
1:25:03
Sense things and I am wanting to test lactose bihoga
1:25:08
I mean so simple there was no need for a mnemonic mnemonic came here it has
1:25:13
something known as neutral red because they ask you in the exam that what is
1:25:19
the indicator that you use in this media the indicator is neutral red and we also
1:25:24
have Toro collate that this media has and Toro collate is something which is going to make it selective but the bile
1:25:30
salt and a sodium torokolate and all these are bile salts so repeating once again McConkey is a pretty pink plant
1:25:36
because plant happens to be its mnemonic and pink happens to be its color because that is why I told you every
1:25:42
fermentation will always be What In Color manitoul sucrose lactose of course yellow hoga where only one pretty pink
1:25:47
plant I told you was an exception and here it is the pretty pink pink plant is my con key coming to the other one we
1:25:53
have another one for lactose fermenter that is known as kled and clad may be job lactose ferment
1:25:58
everywhere we get a yellow color but they will ask you what is the indicator that you use over here indicator is btb
1:26:05
bromo thymol blue indicator is going to be bromo thymol blue so indicator is blue
1:26:12
but the color everywhere for fermenting is yellow so now they will ask you which is better is it going to be meconkey or
1:26:18
is it going to be cleared it is cleared which is better why is cleared better because it is less inhibitory this is
1:26:25
what is written in the books Matlab everything written in the books doesn't make sense automatically it is less
1:26:30
inhibitory means it's more convenient it will allow everyone to grow like for example I consider myself as a less
1:26:37
inhibitory teacher which means that if you have a very very simple doubt or if you have a very complicated doubt I
1:26:42
always make sure that you should speak out and you should clear it off right so I'm not gonna create that scare I'm a
1:26:47
less inhibitory teacher okay so I've just done a little bit of self praise also over here okay on that note so
1:26:53
remember this is going to allow everything to grow it will allow the gram positive organisms also to grow it
1:26:58
will allow the gram negative organisms also to grow but this may concave this Mekong key is not very good this my
1:27:05
concrete doesn't allow the gram positives to grow so your pretty pink is pink and happy it does not allow
1:27:11
everyone to grow cloud is very very nice it is going to allow the gram positives and the gram negatives to grow that is
1:27:16
why it is said to be better all said and done speaking so much about lactose fermenters what are the lactose
1:27:23
fermenters guys we have E coli and klebsiella sounds E coli and klebsiella
1:27:28
lactose fermenters so both of them are going to give me what color both of them
1:27:33
are going to give me a pink color how do I differentiate because it's cubby color
1:27:39
pink Hogan is Cubby color pink hoga but I am here over saying this is a case of klebziella how confident am I about it
1:27:45
very confident why because klebzel is going to be pink as well as mucoidos why
1:27:51
mucoid because anything klebsiella is k k Matlab capsulated anything that is
1:27:57
capsulated gives a mucoid colony anything so can you see it's got that shine on its surface it's got a shine on
1:28:04
its surface that shine is basically because because it has capsule capsules
1:28:11
that is how I differentiated but for differentiating I have one more set of
1:28:16
tests also that I do and those are known as the invict testing I think for the for the time being Pele though how have
1:28:22
I written it I've written it in very different colors I will quickly revision I forward in
1:28:28
dual test Mr for methyl red V for wolves prosecutor test and C for citrate test
1:28:34
repeating we have the indole test methyl red test vogue's
1:28:40
prosecutor test and citrate test why have I written them in these colors because when will I say indole is
1:28:45
positive methyl red is positive and Vox prosecure is positive what color have I written in front of them so I have
1:28:51
written a red color in front of them henna so remember whenever I will get a red color that is when I am going to say
1:28:59
that they are going to be positive on the other hand when I get a blue color that is when I say that citrate
1:29:06
utilization is positive the bus exam red red blue red red blue so let me make you
1:29:12
analyze testing you are going to search for red red red do you get a red color here yes
1:29:30
citrate for citrate I should have got a blue color here I don't get a blue color so this is also negative what did you
1:29:36
write it as now positive positive negative negative this is the feature of E coli E coli plus plus minus minus look
1:29:44
at the next one red red red color negative next one
1:29:50
negative next one positive red color so last one citrate citrate am I getting a
1:29:57
blue color Yes positive minus minus plus plus and minus minus
1:30:02
plus plus is cleb zlr so now in the exam when you get confused between E coli and
1:30:08
klebsiella point number one is klebsiella is not just pink it is also mucoid because it's a capsule secondly
1:30:14
for E coli you will learn that it is plus plus minus minus in its invict testing whereas klebsialize Ulta it is
1:30:21
minus minus plus plus in its invict testing do you want to do the invict testing for this entire family this
1:30:27
entire family is known as what guys this entire family is known as the enterobacteracia family I am Telling You
1:30:32
for the enterobactericia family remember this invict testing tell me which of
1:30:38
them are lactose fermenters do we already know this information coli and klebsia like
1:30:44
lactose ferment
1:30:56
then which of them are motile I can see all of them are motile but which of them are non-motile
1:31:02
klebsiella Ella Matlab non-motal shigella Ella his non-motile rest all of
1:31:07
them are motile some rare rare amounts of salmonella can also be non-modile
1:31:12
some rare rare types of salmonella so I have learned Ella what is the meaning of
1:31:19
no all my students from the South had taught me that
1:31:27
is going to be non-motile some some
1:31:32
salmonella is gonna be non-motal bakis
1:31:38
coming to the invict testing that is also simple I already know between klebsiella and E coli pehle
1:31:47
importance do plus plus minus minus minus plus plus I know what am I left
1:31:53
with next in invict testing if I say only and only
1:31:58
methyl red is positive rest everything is negative so what are you gonna say I am red and shy
1:32:05
I am red so methyl red and shy I am red and shy shy for what shy for shigella
1:32:12
you can check for yourself
1:32:19
only methyl red so what is methyl red I am red and shy I am red and shy so
1:32:24
shigella and your senior sorted now what is the only thing that I'm left with salmonella salmonella is minus plus
1:32:31
minus plus how do I learn it because salmonella I know there is a very very famous testing called the typhoid fever
1:32:38
Wala testing Vidal test and in Vidal test what antigens do you test you test for o h o h we always test for o antigen
1:32:46
H antigenous antibody H antibody o h o h buses
1:32:54
minus minus and H looks like definitely here so plus plus that sometimes we have
1:33:01
to come across with random and useless stories but now that's the case now exam hey foreign
1:33:35
finally on that note in submissive I ask you out of all of these which of them can show you swarming what was that
1:33:41
mnemonic that I told you for swarming which of them shows you swarming out of all of these we all remember Proteus was
1:33:46
showing you swarming and the Proteus is going to show you swarming it is roaming around swarming
1:33:52
also it does roaming around it shows you any kind of reaction I don't have to
1:33:57
learn anything variable reaction that is what you see on imvik so sorted now if I ask you just randomly if I say there is
1:34:03
an organism which is minus plus minus plus what is this reminding you under here
1:34:10
this must be salmonella then if I ask you there is an organism which is just methyl red positive just methyl red
1:34:17
positive what are you gonna say shigella and your senior see now life has become a lot easier I hope yes so the invict
1:34:24
testing is also sorted for us what am I gonna move on to next because I was
1:34:29
talking about salmonella and shigella and we know that okay causes dysentery salmonella causes
1:34:36
typhoided but now they ask you a question what are their media now there I call them salmonella shigella sisters
1:34:42
SSS why do I call them salmonella shigella sisters because when I talk about the enrichment media
1:34:50
they have what do they have selenite F broth and tetrathionate broth so yes we have it written selenite F broth and
1:34:56
Tetra thione by the way broth broth means liquid
1:35:02
broth like chicken soup broth so broth broth Matlab liquid enrichment word also means this media is gonna be liquid so
1:35:08
enrichment broth chicken soup broth Jessa so selenite F broth Tetra thion broth salmonella sisters when you talk
1:35:15
about selective media also you will realize there are so many media but they're all the same
1:35:21
[Music] deoxy collate Wala media xld DCA deoxy collate are the same then one to Media
1:35:29
is only named as SS sisters the salmonella agar and the other is the hectin enteric agar enteric will remind
1:35:35
you of enteric fever enteric fever Matlab typhoid Matlab salmonella so all these will come into place xld DCA SS
1:35:42
and enteric fever for salmonella shigella sisters however the question that came in the Feb in the fmg exam
1:35:48
that was conducted right now and why am I constantly focusing on this exam because this is the only exam of this year which you have is reference and
1:35:54
it's the same governing body so fmg which is the one which can differentiate between them finally who is going to
1:36:01
create so there's a boy called Wilson Wilson is going to come and break the bond between the two sisters the
1:36:06
salmonella shigella sisters will be broken by Wilson and Blair because these salmonella shigella sisters are broken
1:36:12
how because firstly Wilson and Blair media are gonna create a black color colony and this is one of the best media
1:36:20
that you have for salmonella salmonella is going to go away with Wilson so salmonella sisters
1:36:26
why because some Wilson boy came into this story and what color colonies yes
1:36:31
you've got black colored colonies everyone's okay with this salmonella shigella story also done shall we move
1:36:37
on to the next set of organisms and here you go in front of you finally the last fermentation that we have to talk about
1:36:43
I have got something called vibrio cholera in front of you as soon as I say vibrio cholera you know for a fact that
1:36:50
I am dealing with what I am dealing with dealing with rice water stools now yes
1:36:57
rice water stools will be a very very important point in fact they also ask you that for rice water stools what is
1:37:04
the mediator adenylate cycle is very famous question a denihilate cyclist Matlab there is an increase in cyclic
1:37:10
amp that is noted increase in cyclic amp very very important okay coming back
1:37:16
what is vibrio vibrio looks like a comma shape organism I can see the comma shape over here vibrio cholera is a sucrose
1:37:25
foment how do I guess perlito fermenter whenever something is a fermenter what color will you get you will always get a
1:37:32
yellow color what medium are you using thiosulphate citrate bile salt sucrose
1:37:38
want to learn the full form never mind even if you know tcbs may s
1:37:44
means sucrose you're good to both Theo sulfate citrate bisole bile salt sucrose
1:37:49
tells me sucrose fermentation and vibrio cholera is a sucrose fermenter whereas vibrio para hemolyticus is not a sucrose
1:37:57
fermented there was no yellow color because there is no sucrose fermentation right finally vibrio cholera shows you a
1:38:04
positive string test that is what you see over here so you have a positive string test yes
1:38:09
now guys please note that I was also telling you about I know vibrio cholera
1:38:15
is what I expected so I'm gonna tell you a little bit extra about it which you might feel that oh my God man what has
1:38:21
happened so simple what kind of stools rice water stools if I am buying the rice I am obviously I'll have to pay for
1:38:28
it so if I will pay for it I will get the rice Matlab my coins and my rice my
1:38:34
coins my coins and my rice what do I mean by that coins is the mnemonic and
1:38:40
rice is the rice water stool coins Matlab this shows you the cholera red reaction C for cholera red reaction C
1:38:47
for it can be Catalyst positive also o for it is oxidase positive it is in dual
1:38:52
test positive nitrate reduction positive sucrose slices and string test so many
1:38:58
tests that's why I had to make that mnemonic what is vibrio cholera vibrio cholera my coins my rice if I pay for
1:39:04
the rice I will get the rice to Rice what is two layer Matlab you paid for it coins is a cholera red reaction cholera word
1:39:12
is telling me catalase positive oxidase positive indole positive n alone is nitrate
1:39:18
reduction as for sucrose lysis and S for string test string test photo I just now showed you which is
1:39:24
sorted so simple my money my coins my rice finally you are done with all the fermenters Mannitol saltagar Matlab I
1:39:31
was testing for manitol fermentation what color will you get ma'am everywhere it's a yellow color
1:39:37
everywhere every fermentation is gonna give me a yellow color till the time I
1:39:43
don't reach the pretty pink plant everything is yellow so manitol fermentation manitoul saltagar what are
1:39:48
the indicator in manitol fermentation do you guys remember it was phenol red okay thiosulphate citrate bile salt sucrose
1:39:56
of course I'm talking about sucrose fermentation vibrio cholera sucrose fermentation and over here also the
1:40:02
indicator is bromothymol blue which is also the indicator of the clad media but
1:40:07
clad medium henna that is why you're doing the lactose fermentation so can you tell me the organisms manitol
1:40:13
fermentation was for staph aureus tcbs is for vibrio cholera and clad is of
1:40:19
course for KK lactose fermentation E coli clebs family so repeating
1:40:28
now let's finally come to the pretty pink plant if you do lactose fermentation and you get a pink color
1:40:35
repeating if you do lactose fermentation and you get a pink color it's a pretty
1:40:41
pink plant and plant May what was the indicator plant made the indicator was neutral red so here you had to mark
1:40:48
neutral red everyone's okay so all the fermentations give me what color yellow color except for the pretty pink plant
1:40:55
that is my con key done talking so much about colors which is that organism that shows you the blue green pigment what is
1:41:01
the question that you get what am I talking about next the question blue green pigment the very famous pseudomonas it can cause
1:41:09
a lot of infections in the body from meningitis to pneumonia so sputum hoga blue green color Burns patient may both
1:41:17
common history other Burns infections are very common and this green nail syndrome this green nail syndrome while
1:41:23
a picture is also very very famous for pseudomonas extremely important pseudomonasa related things that I have
1:41:29
told you and you know fluoroquinolones is what you're gonna give for the treatment I hope that aspect of pharmacology you remember what am I left
1:41:38
with next I'm gonna finish off this with the study of two things one we are going to talk about mycobacteria and then
1:41:43
we're also going to quickly look at pictures of Spyro kids mycobacteria photos so I don't think we need to spend
1:41:49
time on when I'm talking about mycobacterium TB we are talking about the Z end State though we know Z and
1:41:56
stain fluorescent May what are the fluorescent stains that you have for mycobacterium TB you have auramine and
1:42:01
rhodamine or amine rhodamina the fluorescent stains for TB done what is the culture media we have the Lowenstein
1:42:08
Jensen medium and what kind of colonies perleto this takes a lot of time this takes approximately six to eight weeks
1:42:14
to grow and what kind of media colonies do you have it's a mnemonic we call it rough buff tough colonies rough buff
1:42:21
tough colonies is what you get on LG media what is rough buff tough rough means obviously they're very rough
1:42:26
they're not at all shiny they're very rough tough means I cannot remove them they're very very adherent very tough
1:42:32
and what is buff so rough and tough though I understand rough and tough colony
1:42:38
because if you look at their color they are not looking like pearly white or a cream off white color and so that is
1:42:44
buff rough buff tough colonies but what did I say it is taking six to eight weeks for the growth
1:42:51
I need something which is faster so I can see some cartridge Wala technique
1:42:56
cartridge based what is cartridge based cartridge based nucleic acid amplification this machine is known as a
1:43:04
gene expert and remember this can not only do the diagnosis but can also tell
1:43:09
me rifampicine resistance it can also tell me resistance to dry phampersin
1:43:14
being present or not so this machine is very very useful it is known as CB net CB net full form dubara cartridge based
1:43:21
nucleic acid amplification testing it's a nucleic acid amplification technique whenever you see something like this
1:43:26
barcode kind of a thing you will know that yeah this is some cartridge thing so cartridge based nucleic acid
1:43:32
amplification not only for the diagnosis but also for the rifampicin resistance
1:43:37
it can tell you I hope everyone's okay with this picture because I'm talking about mycobacterium TB one picture of
1:43:42
mycobacterium leprosy is also coming to my mind and what is that picture of mycobacterium lepra because we don't
1:43:48
have any culture media that's why I can't show you any pictures for culture media it's not there but I
1:43:54
have the nine banded armadillo the question that they can give you is the nine banded armadillo because that is
1:44:01
the animal inoculation that I have to do and if you have any time in life you can sit and count as nine bands your wish
1:44:07
but nine banded armadillo which you can see over here is the animal in which you grow mycobacterium lepra because this
1:44:14
comes under there is no culture media under which you can grow it I hope you all remember this yes there is
1:44:22
a next set of picture that I was telling you about what is the last family that we are going to discuss the Spyro kids
1:44:27
so jaldi say we will talk about Spiro kids what do you have over here we have triponema we have borrelia we have
1:44:33
leptospira triponema borrelia and leptospira though you should be able to identify them
1:44:41
very very tight coils Spyro Matlab all of them are gonna be
1:44:48
spiral but Loose spiral uh tight spirals so triponema has very tight tight coils
1:44:54
and because it has very tight tight coils what kind of a motility will it have it looks like a corkscrew so I call
1:45:00
it a tight Titanic it's gonna show me the corkscrew motility
1:45:05
it is going to show me the corkscrew motility so triponema tight tight coils
1:45:10
Corkscrew motility is relaxed the most relaxed person in
1:45:16
life is borrelia who are relaxed person is
1:45:22
so it has very loose coils it has very loose coils and borrelia has La that is
1:45:28
lashing motility so remember it is relaxed hair loose coils hair lashing
1:45:36
motility here that is finally leptospira leptospira is
1:45:41
because you will see hooked ends leptospira is as if you know for those who don't know Hindi means folding okay
1:45:48
means folding so it has hooked ends and hooked ends are just going to give it a motility no special name repeating once
1:45:55
again we have triponema for tight tight screw like screw motility borrelia
1:46:00
boredom relaxing relaxing loose lashing motility and then leptospira lapeta
1:46:05
what's a hooked ends but you know what why are they motile you say ma'am it's
1:46:11
not time that's the basic question why are you asking us that because they
1:46:16
don't have a flagella they have something known as an endo flagella that is why I'm asking you this question everywhere I say motility I understand
1:46:24
but here it is an endo flagella endoflagella means what you don't have to know the picture on the right I just
1:46:30
want to tell you that Endo Flagyl is something that is present in this space can you see this uh these blue color
1:46:36
white color lines hiding Endo flagella is hiding in the periplasmic space that is a general micro question
1:46:43
that you have it is endoflagella in the periplasmic space done with this so now
1:46:49
out of these let's quickly look at what do I have to see for their clinical profile you know this is a case of
1:46:54
syphilis you know it's a case of syphilis and syphilisca incubation period because 9 to 90 days incubation
1:47:02
period of Syphilis is 9 to 90 days it's a venereal disease so I can first see that in primary syphilis I can see that
1:47:09
there's a genital ulcer so remember syphilis is less if they ask you what is the
1:47:17
situation of the ulcer you will say it is a painless ulcer and if they ask you what is the situation of the lymph node
1:47:23
you will say it is a painless lymph node so simple and you have a pain less less situation so if you less less approach
1:47:29
pain less less so ulcer is what you see over here which you call as a Shankar now we come to the next one that
1:47:36
is going to be this was seen in primary syphilis because now I'm coming to the secondary syphilis secondary syphilis
1:47:42
which you can see and next what you see is these nodules on the mucocutaneous
1:47:47
junction known as condylomata Latta so instead of learning it as condylometer Lata I will learn it
1:47:54
as condylou May 2 La 2 because this will tell me that this is going to happen in the secondary phase of syphilis
1:48:00
condylomate 2 latto secondary phase don't confuse it with condyloma acumenitum condyloma accumulating with
1:48:06
the words that you study in surgery in Gynecology in pathology or HPV
1:48:12
this is seen in secondary cephalus TK now
1:48:17
finally coming to what if the patient lands up with tertiary syphilis this I think we all know tertiary syphilis
1:48:22
means there is involvement of the vital organs like cardiovascular and CNS CNS General Paris is
1:48:31
general parasis of in insane which insane word has been removed and now they only like to call it General
1:48:37
parishes you know that is important so whether you talk about primary secondary tertiary sophilus
1:48:43
so the stain that I have over here is a blackish color stain so if a tissue has
1:48:48
been given to me which black color stain will I use I will use the livadity stain
1:48:54
but if a film has been given to me I will use the Fontana stain very very
1:49:00
simple both of them are black color stains the only difference is that other f for film
1:49:07
DIA to F for Fontana voila black use karna and tissue
1:49:12
both of them are black Fontana and levity Fontana fulfillmentity for
1:49:17
tissues so this is done but what are the testings that you will do which microscope is this in which you can see
1:49:23
everything is dark so yes pyro kids can be seen in dark field microscopy spirochets are noted in dark field
1:49:30
microscopy what are the other tests that we have we have something called a vdrl test and an rpr test these are important
1:49:36
tests that you have for syphilis questions simple here that when there is involvement of neurosyphilis what is the
1:49:42
investigation of choice that you have for neurosyphilis so remember neurosyphilis killer vdrl vdrl basically
1:49:48
CSF samples are tested for on vdrl not on rpr that is the investigation of
1:49:53
choice for new syphilis what is the treatment of syphilis I think everyone knows benzo think penicillin is the
1:49:58
treatment which Pata so coming back I was talking about syphilis pictures of syphilis are done triponema basically
1:50:04
triponema pallidum triponema pallidum civil is done one thing that I want to tell you which I'm expecting this time
1:50:10
is leptospira leptospiramillapeta what is that so firstly leptospira is
1:50:16
going to have those hooked ends next I want to call it the wheels
1:50:22
disease what is Wheels disease so Wheels Matlab round and round round and round so remember the round and round cube
1:50:29
right because like the wheel sounds like a wheel henna and round and round because of course
1:50:35
there is jaundice so there's jaundice and
1:50:40
Hemorrhage jaundice and Hemorrhage jaundice Matlab hepatic jaundice Matlab hepatic hemorrhagic renal involvement so
1:50:47
either you call it ector or hemorrhagic fever or you call it hepato renal syndrome
1:50:52
Wheels disease but what is RR this is associated with rat urine which tends to
1:50:58
contaminate the Rainy water in rice field workers it happens so because rice
1:51:05
paddy Fields have a lot of water now so that water has been contaminated by rat urine so rat urine contaminating the
1:51:11
Rainy water and who are the people who are gonna get it the Paddy field workers or the rice field workers the rat rainy
1:51:17
rice at rainy rice and what I'm gonna get in
1:51:22
my testing is a ring can you all see over here there is a ring that is formed this is known as the dinger's ring which
1:51:28
you see on emgh media there is a ring so finally I come to the last star rat rainy rat rainy water rat urine
1:51:36
contaminating rainy water rice field workers dingers ring is seen to a round round round round that is gonna be the
1:51:43
wheel that is gonna be the wheel and that is Wheels disease fever
1:51:48
all sorted doxycycline penicillin these are the treatments mostly for this entire family penicillin drugs are used
1:51:55
for the treatment coming to the last one which I cannot at all ignore because you know this very
1:52:01
famous fried egg appearance and fried egg appearance is seen in which particular bacteria it is seen in
1:52:08
mycoplasma very very good it is seen in mycoplasma also guys please note that mycoplasma if I ask you any fungus that
1:52:16
shows you fried egg appearance the fungus showing you fried egg appearance is going to be malice easier for fur so
1:52:22
ultimately I realized that fried eggs are both M's in microbiology mycoplasma
1:52:27
bacteria malicea for fungus both of them show you fried egg appearance but however in mycoplasma they ask you this
1:52:33
fried egg appearances seen on which agar Friday appearance is seen on it mycoplasma
1:52:40
agar is going to be the pplo agar and mycoplasma stain is also asked and that
1:52:45
is the dying sting Dyne stain and pplo agar is what they are going to ask you over here and with that whatever
1:52:53
best in bacteriology that I could cover in this short and Rapid session I think
1:52:59
we have at least 16 or 14 hours of bacteria which we've tried to cover in one hour quite a task never did I
1:53:05
thought that I would feel so breathless in doing so but yes mission accomplished these are your primary things that you
1:53:10
have to study after that if you get time you have all the time to study other bacteria but in pay the most most
1:53:16
important you have to give importance right so now we are going to do what next we are going to go on to quickly in
1:53:21
half an hour we are going to study all the important images and points that you have for virology DNA RNA viruses yes we
1:53:28
are going to do an image based study right going forward let's begin now we are going to move ahead and talk
1:53:33
about virology so in virology I've picked up a certain number of topics which are definitely expected so quickly
1:53:40
let's Crush through them let's keep a target of 30 35 minutes and wrap it off so here in virology first you would have
1:53:46
to know the classification we all know we have DNA as well as RNA viruses and for DNA viruses we have a happy mnemonic
1:53:53
what is Happy mnemonic first and foremost we have hepadna viride tells me that this is the only hepatitis
1:54:00
which is a DNA virus Hepatitis B rest all the hepatitis are going to be RNA viruses then next we talk about Herpes
1:54:07
very day herpes viride family is definitely a very very long family that we have because we have human herpes
1:54:13
virus one two three four five six and so on then we have something known as adenoviride family
1:54:21
then we have something called papova viride papoviride
1:54:26
there is something called parvoviride which is obviously going to have parvo virus that there is polyoma viride
1:54:33
family there is polyoma viride family and finally there is a faj means
1:54:39
bacteriophage bacteriophage is something that helps in transfer of genetic material so okay out of these which are
1:54:45
the ones that I'm gonna show you eventually I'll show you some points about each one of them but everything other than this
1:54:51
herpes hepatna that is Hepatitis B with herpes with Adeno with parvo with papova
1:54:58
with polyoma and fajj the happy become DNA and then everything else becomes the RNA viruses so now you don't have to
1:55:05
learn separately everything else on this planet will then become and come under the family of RNA viruses so the first
1:55:13
thing that we have to actually focus on are on the shapes then I'll come back to the classification let's do a quick
1:55:18
revision of all the shapes and viruses are very small in nanometers you can't see them on a light microscope you'll
1:55:23
see them on an electron microscope so first and foremost reaches the virus that looks like a bullet a bullet is
1:55:29
going to kill of course what is going to kill rabies is going to kill so rabies virus is a bullet shaped virus the virus
1:55:35
that Drew in three three and a half years of everyone's life that is Coronavirus and everything everyone
1:55:40
knows that it Corona means Crown it looks like a crown and what is giving it that Crown these are the peplomas it
1:55:47
basically contains peplomers coming to the next the virus which looks like a box or a brick so I
1:55:54
say pox is a box what is box is a box we have something called like a pox virus and pox is going to look like a box like
1:56:01
a box or a brick so either you can call it a box or you can call it a break and box and brick is very heavy why is it
1:56:07
heavy because it's got a dumbbell shaped DNA the DNA inside it is going to be a
1:56:13
dumbbell shaped DNA core so repeating here we have a bullet rabies bullet so bullet will kill rabies will kill we all
1:56:20
know that Corona looks like a crown no doubt about it box is a box and that box has a dumbbell so dumbbell DNA now the
1:56:27
one that looks like a cigarette so why have I told you the rod shaped one the rod shaped one is TM wheat cigarette has
1:56:32
tobacco now so tobacco mosaic virus TMV or tobacco mosaic virus is going to look
1:56:38
actually like a cigarette only so you will always think of tobacco out of it coming to the next one what is this that
1:56:44
you see the easiest one the one that looks like a star the star one is going to be Astro virus it can cause diarrhea
1:56:50
astrovirus is known as a gastroenteritis while organism then we have another diarrhea organism diarrhea in children
1:56:58
that is a rotating wheel the rotating wheel is a rotavirus the one that looks exactly like a rotating wheel so
1:57:04
remember Rota for rotating wheel and you have some very very famous questions for
1:57:10
it that you have what disease that happens because of it we have diarrhea that happens because of it and then the
1:57:17
vaccine of course there's a rotar x there is a rotavirus vaccine what is one of the side effects or complications of
1:57:24
the vaccine which you get in Pediatrics that is going to be intussusception intussusception can happen because of
1:57:30
the vaccination for rotavirus coming to the next we have this bowl of spaghetti why do I say bowl of spaghetti because
1:57:36
as I say bowl of spaghetti it reminds me of bola Ebola is going to look like a
1:57:42
bowl of spaghetti spaghetti pasta so instead of learning it as spaghetti The Examiner will write it as filamentious
1:57:48
it means the same finally which is the virus which is going to look like a space vehicle alien
1:57:55
alien is going to come from the adenovirus alien is going to come from the
1:58:00
adenovirus adenovirus can cause a lot of things but one very very famous question is that adenovirus is associated with
1:58:08
the diarrhea adenovirus is associated with diarrhea and they call they ask you what strains of adenovirus calls it
1:58:15
remember adenovirus 4041 adenovirus 4041 are going to cause diarrhea they'll give
1:58:21
you options like 20 19 7 10 40 41 so I know it's not appropriate to say so but
1:58:26
the way you say diarrhea diarrhea basically means diarrhea means spotty right so that's
1:58:32
40. that is how you're gonna learn it so diarrhea is caused by adenovirus 4041 those are the strains which cause
1:58:38
diarrhea so quick revision of the shapes once again bullet kills and rabies kills Corona looks like a crown box is a box a
1:58:45
heavy box with a dumbbell DNA the tobacco mosaic virus obviously will look like a cigarette or a rod then the
1:58:50
rotating wheel is going to be a Rota virus the star is common sense Astro virus bowl of spaghetti is going to be
1:58:56
Ebola and alien that alien valid that is why I made you
1:59:02
learn the alien Vala is going to be the adenovirus and adenovirus 4041 causes diarrhea so the shapes are done what do
1:59:09
we move on to the next part so I've given you a list of topics the shapes are done for us before I go on to the
1:59:14
inclusions I want to First teach you the rules what are the rules so remember all these DNA viruses that I just taught you
1:59:20
they have a rule that all the DNA viruses are double stranded all the DNA viruses are double stranded except this
1:59:27
poor Paro you know why do I call her poor Paro Paro from devdas by poor because the sparrow has got everything
1:59:33
see Paro is left alone night that movie just in case you happen to watch devdas Ever she was left alone her husband also
1:59:38
died and then Shahrukh Khan also died that is what the movie was sopara was left alone she is the only single stranded DNA and you know one more very
1:59:45
very sad thing about parvovirus this is the smallest DNA virus that we have
1:59:50
this is the smallest DNA virus that we have so repeating Paro is left alone and small that is single stranded and the
1:59:56
smallest DNA virus that is for Paro parvovirus now after that I will have to tell you everything about RNA viruses
2:00:03
also it's very very simple nothing complicated as at all so what do you have to know about just a second yes
2:00:10
what do you have to know about the RNA viruses so it seems very scary very very complicated but I say hey it's very
2:00:16
simple listen to me all the RNA viruses first know the normal rule then I'll
2:00:21
come to the exception all the RNA viruses have how many copies one copy so let me draw it it's just going to be a
2:00:28
single copy fine next what kind of RNA single stranded so I'm
2:00:33
not drawing it like this no no no I'm not drawing a double stranded single copy single Strand and unsegmented I
2:00:41
have not made any segments out of it it is totally plain unsegmented the bot simple I have one copy one strand no
2:00:49
segmentation that is how RNA viruses are except everything is the same but I make
2:00:55
two copies so now you'll say that there are two copies but everything else is the same single stranded here
2:01:00
unsegmented here but two copies here remember red two virus what is red two virus that is how I have learned it red
2:01:07
two viruses nothing but red true virus no red true virus so what do we have over here the way you will write it here
2:01:13
onwards HIV all of you have seen the HIV virus HIV structure it has two copies of RNA
2:01:20
sitting inside it now so now all of you know that okay when I'm talking about Red 2 virus it has two copies next
2:01:26
everything is the same the copies are also single but instead of single stranded the RNA becomes double stranded
2:01:33
double stranded RNA is a Rio virus remember double stranded RNA is the
2:01:40
diarrhea but show me diarrhea diarrhea Rota virus is nothing but Rio virus only
2:01:46
diarrhea organism is double stranded RNA so remember diarrhea
2:01:51
diarrhea the Rota virus the Rio virus that is double standard RNA coming to
2:01:58
the last one now again I have the same single copy single strand but this time it is segmented what is segmented Matlab
2:02:06
it is broker into different pieces who will be
2:02:11
broken someone who's going to consume alcohol be rabira is an alcoholic beverage so remember someone who
2:02:16
consumes alcohol is going to be fallen all over the place so which is the viruses which are going to be segmented
2:02:21
broken into pieces the beera viruses what does that include B for Bunya virus I for influenza influenza influenza we
2:02:29
are talking about the ortho mix oviride family so beera also you can remember beta or Bora whatever works for you
2:02:36
right so influenza Ortho mix over a day then we have R for again Rota virus or
2:02:41
rotavirus has a lot of exceptions it is segmented also and rotavirus was that diarrhea which was diarrhea double
2:02:48
stranded RNA that also and a for arena virus now they will also ask you in how many segments have you broken them so
2:02:55
remember the way you write Bunya the Bunya is telling you that it is broken into three segments the way you write
2:03:01
influenza that will tell you that it is broken into eight segments then three plus eight eleven so Rota virus is
2:03:08
broken into 11 segments and one plus one two so Arena virus is broken into two
2:03:14
segments let's do a recap when I'm talking about Bunya Bunya looks like a 3B so three segments I looks like eight
2:03:21
so it is eight segments then three and eight adkara eleven Ruta virus 11 segments one plus one two Arena virus
2:03:27
two segments that is the segmentation I hope everyone is clear remember these are the exceptions for the RNA viruses
2:03:33
and these were the exceptions for the DNA viruses DNA viruses include what all of them are double stranded but Power is
2:03:40
left alone parvoviruses single stranded so here we go we are done with our we
2:03:45
are done with our next checklist we are done with the rules also of rules next before I come to inclusions because I
2:03:50
was just talking about all these DNA viruses let me give you a quick recap about these DNA viruses that you have to
2:03:57
know let me show you all their pictures so first and foremost the virus that was left alone the Paro what all can it
2:04:02
cause and this is very very important parvovirus b19 so I've got you a couple of pictures just learn it like this
2:04:09
everything is red red red red cheeks remember red red cheeks red red hands red red feet and red red in the bone
2:04:14
marrow is gone that is how I have learned it very
2:04:20
simple so parvovirus this Paro Paro is crying so much now Paro has cried so
2:04:25
much so she has red red cheeks Now red face red hands red feet and all her red from bone marrow has gone so remember
2:04:32
first and foremost this is known as the slapped cheek appearance I think this everyone knows the famous slab cheek
2:04:38
appearance previously question then you can see the red red color rash on the hands and the feet also which is also
2:04:44
known as the gloves and stocking syndrome then you can see along the same joints there is involvement of the
2:04:49
joints also so remember red red face red red hand red red feet and joint pain is
2:04:54
also going to be there apart from that all the red from because everything is red now so I have all the red from the
2:05:00
bone marrow has gone there is going to be red cell aplasia or a plastic crisis that happens in the bone marrow bone
2:05:06
marrow my red cells where did the Red Cell go red cells of digestive way of learning a red face red hand red feet so
2:05:14
bone marrow car red gone there is pure red cell laplasia and there is a plastic crisis and if this happens in um and you
2:05:22
know in try uterine condition it results in High Drops fetalis these are all the conditions associated with parvovirus
2:05:28
b19 you know this is the Chota Wala single stranded DNA virus it's the
2:05:33
smallest and it is single stranded I hope everyone's okay with parvovirus the next one that I'm going to show you is
2:05:40
definitely the very famous zanx mirror that we talk about in which situation do
2:05:46
we talk about Zang smear we talk about Zang smear in case of herpes to pelito sang smear is taken from whatever side
2:05:52
the whether it is hsv1 herpes simplex one or Herpes Simplex 2 or herpes zoster depending on the site of the rash you
2:05:59
are going to take a Zhang smear and after that you are going to put a stain on top of it lots of stains can be used
2:06:04
for a Zang smear you can use gym sustain you can use leishman stain all these stains are known for zangs made even
2:06:11
toluudine blue is known for Zhang smear what do you see over here is very very interesting firstly whenever you're
2:06:16
talking about Herpes you get to see the 3ms you get to see the three M's which I have taught you a million times earlier
2:06:23
what are the three M's firstly the cells are going to be multi-nuclear there is multi-nucleation you can very well see
2:06:29
there are lots of nuclei that are present second there is going to be molding all the nuclei are fitting into each
2:06:37
other thirdly there is going to be margination there is going to be margination the nuclei are all chromatin
2:06:42
at the margin the more of the chromatic is going to be at the margin so there is multi-nucleation there is molding and
2:06:48
there is margination three M's but apart from that you can also see some inclusions which are known as cow dry a
2:06:55
inclusions and they are also referred to as the life Schultz bodies cow dry a
2:07:00
inclusions are also referred to as the life Schultz body so repeating zanx mere question herpes related definitely AGA
2:07:08
you know it's a previous year question you know it's very very important so this was one we are all in the herpes
2:07:14
family but if I now because herpes word was coming herpes simplex herpes zoster now I'll say this is also
2:07:20
the herpes family but the herpes word doesn't come this is human herpes virus 4 and that is going to be Epstein-Barr
2:07:27
virus Epstein Barbados now how did I so easily pick up Epstein-Barr virus first
2:07:33
and foremost question number one pick up all the questions Epstein-Barr virus enters which cells of our body EBV will
2:07:41
go into the B cells question number one Epstein-Barr virus goes into your B cells okay after that question number
2:07:47
two How does it go into the B cell it goes into B cell via cd21 CR2 receptor B
2:07:53
cell cd21 CR2 receptor okay question number three after going into the B
2:07:58
cells what all does it release 1 to 10 1 to 10 Matlab it releases LMP 1 then abna
2:08:05
2 and interleukin 10 viral Intel you can tell we don't release until you can tell
2:08:11
he has got his own interleuk intent so remember what does Epstein-Barr virus release I told you it releases 1 to 10
2:08:17
in lmp1 Ebner 2 interleukin 10. as a result of which there are a lot of diseases that are going to happen so
2:08:23
subsequently the disease which is very very famous is the Infectious mononucleosis or the kissing disease why
2:08:29
kissing disease because it spreads by very close contact and what is the other name for it the other name for it is
2:08:35
going to be glandular fever why glandular fever fever obviously because fever and glandular mat loves salivary
2:08:41
gland hoga lymph node these are big big salivary gland is enlarged lymph nodes is enlarged hepatosphere so these are
2:08:48
all the big big glands that are there so kissing disease because of close contact and glandular fever because of glands
2:08:54
and fever that is infectious mononucleosis now when you do a blood test in a patient of infectious
2:09:00
mononucleosis please note that the blood test is going to show you this ballerina skirt appearance like a ballet dancer
2:09:07
the cells the blood blood test is going to show you the ballerina skirt appearance and these cells are referred
2:09:13
to as the Downy cells and you will ask me what are Downy cells and to your surprise if I ask you are they B cells
2:09:19
or T cells students believe that acha EBV was going into B cell to this must be a B cell no Downy cells are cd8 T
2:09:27
cells why because B cells are already in a lot of problem Epstein-Barr viruses
2:09:32
attacking them B cells he calls his cousin brother he calls his T Cell cousin brother and says can you
2:09:38
help me I mean like big time trouble so yes the CDA T cells are coming to the rescue they show you like a
2:09:45
like uh you know a superhero cape they are going to put out their ballerina skirt and they're gonna come running
2:09:51
towards their cousin brother that is what you have for Downey cells so this is ballerina skirt or downy cell which
2:09:57
you see in infectious mononucleosis but if you're still not happy about it and you say that no a blood test is not
2:10:02
gonna do the diagnosis what are the tests that you can do I think everyone knows a very famous test called the Paul
2:10:08
bunnel test honestly telling you this is only for McQ no one does it but there's a modification of a Paul Bunyan desk
2:10:14
which is done nowadays and that is the monospot test so always remember when the word mono spot will be given it will
2:10:20
indicate that Epstein-Barr virus so yes Epstein-Barr virus these are the main
2:10:26
questions infectious mononucleosis Downy cells question number two via cd21 CR2
2:10:33
question number three it releases lmp1 Ebner 2 intel you can 10 1 to 10. diseases infectious mononucleosis or
2:10:39
kissing disease or glandular fever cells that you see on a blood test or ballerina skirt appearance or downy
2:10:45
cells which are CDs 8 the tests of all bundle or bonus quad test but that's not the only thing that it causes can it
2:10:51
also cause carcinomas yes it can cause carcinoma especially water it can cause gastric carcinoma it can cause
2:10:57
nasopharyngeal carcinoma gastric carcinoma is the more common one AB previous year question a gastric cancer
2:11:03
is the most common cancer that occurs with EBV after that it can cause lymphomas lymphoma may subcoach it can
2:11:10
cause Hodgkin's lymphoma it can cause Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Non-Hodgkin's paint can cause buckets also it can
2:11:15
cause dlbcl also so but what no one ever ever learns is can
2:11:21
it cause a sarcoma also yes it can cause Leo myosarcoma that is usually ignored
2:11:28
carcinoma sarcoma lymphoma but what is the most common carcinoma that it causes
2:11:34
again and again and again I'm repeating earlier it was nasopharyngeal Abul jao now it is not nasopharyngeal now the
2:11:40
more common one is going to be the gastric carcinoma sorted with this Epstein-Barr virus story
2:11:49
what is that that is the cytomegalovirus and there is no need for me to tell you
2:11:54
that it definitely shows you the auli appearance what is appearance so firstly you see these blue blue color eyes means
2:12:01
you are seeing intra-nuclear inclusions okay but other than that does it also
2:12:07
show you inclusions or a bunch of inclusions in the cytoplasm yes it also
2:12:12
shows you intracytoplasmic inclusion so there are both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions that are
2:12:18
noted I hope that is okay with everyone which other virus can show you
2:12:23
intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions one of them is definitely in front of you CMV the other one is
2:12:30
Measles measles shows you which giant cell worth in Finkel day giant cell in case you've
2:12:36
forgotten by now in the beginning of the session I give you all one homework also and that was pathology what is the
2:12:42
granuloma that you see in plasmodium falcifero I'm still waiting for the answer in the comments okay I'll be checking on that on that note guys
2:12:49
coming back cytomegalovirus shows you both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusion so does measles of
2:12:55
cytomegalovirus there are some saturated when I say saturated questions there's
2:13:01
nothing Beyond it that the examiner can ask that I have done next I will ask you
2:13:06
what kind of infections will it cause you'll usually be given either an HIV positive patient or some kind of
2:13:12
transplant Wala history right so transplant there is going to be an infection and they will ask you that
2:13:19
where does cytomegalovirus go and two things where does it work where does it rest all of you have a workplace and a
2:13:25
home and a home is where you rest and workplaces where you work ticket in most of the cases but for doctors it's
2:13:31
nothing like that at home also we are working in workplace also we are working but for otherwise non-medicals home is
2:13:36
where you rest and workplaces where you work so on on that note where is cytomegalovirus multiplying in and where
2:13:43
is it sleeping in so remember srk srk firstly tell me everyone knows srk to
2:13:49
look at his favorite action so he is telling you that Mega he's the king of Bollywood so he's the mega to remember
2:13:55
srk will remind you of site Omega megalovirus and srk Matlab this is srk
2:14:00
so that is multiplication multiplication is going to be where in the salivary gland in the respiratory tract and the
2:14:07
kidney srk is working where in the salivary gland respiratory tract and kidney but where does srk go to sleep
2:14:13
where does srk go to sleep to his house manat so what do I say where does srk
2:14:18
become latent where does it sleep in mannat manat means monocyte so srk is salivary respiratory kidney that is when
2:14:25
he's working but when he has to sleep he goes to mannat and that mannat is a monocyte and that is how you're going to
2:14:31
learn this so definitely this is going to be our history so they will say either there's a kidney infection or CMV
2:14:37
esophagitis or any other CMV infection that will be there but the owl I will always follow you I hope everyone's okay
2:14:43
with it one more virus that you have to know which belongs to the DNA family only is going to be this the very very
2:14:49
famous Dermatology question which is molluscum contagious contagiosum comes under which family
2:14:55
molluscum contagiosum is a pox virus so do you know the shape of it do you remember pox is a box and boxes
2:15:01
something that is going to have a very heavy DNA box is a box with a DNA so yes that is sorted how do you see it under
2:15:06
the clinical situation it is an amplicated papule amplicated lesion what do I mean by unlicated Matlab Center me
2:15:13
whole Center me depression Center my obligation what does that mean because then I'll press this there is going to
2:15:20
be a discharge that will come out so then I decided let me look at this entire thing under the microscope under
2:15:27
the microscope I saw there was something like this there was a cup shaped lesion
2:15:32
and inside that cup shaped lesion I could see lots and lots of pink color
2:15:38
bodies all of you can visualize these you know if I go from the bottom most if
2:15:43
you see from the bottom most if I go all the way up you can see it right till the upper layer so it's starting from the
2:15:49
bottom most all these pink pink dots they are going all the way up till here so these are known as the HP bodies what
2:15:55
are HP bodies these are referred to as the Henderson Patterson bodies these are
2:16:00
referred to as the Henderson Patterson bodies which are referred to as the HP bodies and a b story is not over what is
2:16:08
the story further renders and patterns and bodies cause special stain and dermatology they ask you floxine
2:16:13
tartarate stain PPP child refloxine tartarate stain so Henderson patterns
2:16:19
and bodies May floxine tartarate stain sugar why did I say PPP because floxin tartar eat stain is for something else
2:16:25
also what is that what is it for floxin tartar Bridge stain so yes truly a
2:16:30
breathless session that this is floxine tartarate stain is of two things so the
2:16:35
P for floxine tartarate will remind you of P4 the HP bodies and P for something in the
2:16:43
GI tract which is the Panic cells so Panic cells are also floxin tartarate
2:16:49
positive so yes on that note guys complicated lesion hookah HP bodies
2:16:54
that is a pox pox is a box like nice Rhymes I feel like school teacher at
2:17:01
times so pox is a box box is heavy heavy queue because it has a double everyone's
2:17:06
clear with this story yes sumalaska also done now moving forward as a result you realized you were doing many of the
2:17:13
inclusions on the way and that is the last thing that I want to actually teach all of you what were those inclusion
2:17:19
bodies that you had to pick up so let's start reading what are inclusion bodies that have studied and what are those that I can study more so subsequently
2:17:26
this we have not seen because everyone knows rabies you still want to see them revise them
2:17:33
once Carlo this is what you have to see they are intracytoplasmic if you feel that how will I identify this in the
2:17:39
exam are they going to give me like um this as a spotter no they will always
2:17:45
give you a dog bite while a history with the hoga dog bite history is not
2:17:50
possible to diagnose so remember these negri bodies that they are talking about either they will be seen in the
2:17:56
cerebellum or they will be seen in the hippocampus so cerebellum or hippocampus negri bodies
2:18:03
are going to be seen and apart from that the last question is what is the stain that you can have for the negri bodies
2:18:10
and that is going to be the cellar stain the cellar stain is going to be for negri body so coming back negri body
2:18:15
they clear now let's move on to the next have we seen molluscum bodies in molluscum this question will never be
2:18:21
asked instead of molluscum bodies they will label it as HP bodies Henderson Patterson bodies yeah that we have
2:18:27
definitely seen in molluscum next in Bowling bodies Deco ball football basketball
2:18:38
[Music] there's an overlap between them but yes
2:18:45
passion is seen in variola guarnieri seen in vaccinia how will you remember this vaccinia has all the seasonal
2:18:52
vaccinia has all the seeds message bodies are seen in vaccinia and pasture
2:18:58
bodies are seen in variola coming to the next which are the two organisms that are I taught you which show you
2:19:05
intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions yes what were they there were CMV and measles
2:19:11
we have seen uh we have already seen the Au Lai appearance isn't it you told me
2:19:17
what are the infinite giant cell maybe I'll show you and finish off weasels when we are talking about the measles
2:19:23
when we are talking about measles I think this everyone identifies from pathology and that was the word in
2:19:29
Finkel day giant cells Warden Finkel de giant cells and you can see the same
2:19:34
thing that I taught you zoom in exam is firstly so you have to be very very sure
2:19:40
that the same picture as it is embedded in your memory because this is the only picture of what didn't think candy that
2:19:46
they have so remember this is the warden Finkel design cell are you gonna say intra nuclear inclusions of course you
2:19:52
can see the intranuclear inclusion so intranuclear is sorted but if you look very carefully there are tiny tiny pink
2:19:57
color dots in the cytoplasm also it shows you both intra nuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions sinus
2:20:03
cytoplasmic here also so yes these are all gonna show you both intra nuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions
2:20:10
coming back this question came in the recent fmg exam and that was the three C's were mentioned what are the three
2:20:16
C's which is the prodromal symptoms that start in measles so you have cough choriza and conjunctivitis cough choriza
2:20:23
and conjunctivitis with of course fever the hugai two days later the patient has complex spots which you can easily
2:20:30
visualize near the buccal on the buccal mucosa near the molar yes buccal mucosa
2:20:36
molar Capas you can see the complex spots and then two days later that is when the rash appears by that time all
2:20:43
that fever and complex spots will go away as if someone has thrown paint on top of you so you will see first it will
2:20:49
go from behind the ears then it's going to be face and then the shoulder and the trunk and all of that so this is the
2:20:55
exact the sequeli which they have shown of how the rash is going to spread 10 days
2:21:03
then two days later there is complex spots two days later there is rash
2:21:08
yes we are done with this I know all of you must also be looking out for measles mumps rubella kamam incubation period
2:21:16
measles mumps and rubella incubation period is very very difficult to learn 10 days
2:21:30
[Music]
2:21:38
what is this confusion never mind when we say MMR start with 10 10
2:21:46
19. 14 as easy as that so 10 day 10 minutes
2:21:56
the incubation period of measles rubella that is sorted for you measles
2:22:07
conjunctiviter then there is complex spot then there is please remember there's a very common
2:22:14
presentation of bilateral parotitis and unilateral orchitis bilateral paraditis
2:22:20
and unilateral unilateral orchitis is how the patient is going to come that is a situation of
2:22:26
mumps I hope that is okay with everyone everyone knows this so coming back measles we have done and we have seen
2:22:33
the we have seen the um you know the common point also why measles and CMP
2:22:38
because they have intra nuclear and intracytoplasmic coming to the next one intra nuclear maybe have cow dry type A
2:22:45
and then we have cow dry type B so remember B so looks like a p so polio virus
2:22:58
type A is seen in Hay means it is seen in yellow fever and it is seen in herpes
2:23:04
virus cow dry type A is seen in a so a hey that is herpes and yellow herpes
2:23:09
already
2:23:15
bodies bodies very very important that you
2:23:23
no and now just one more homework for you yellow fever cup please please vaccine per dinner the 17 D vaccine PSM
2:23:30
May question very very important coming back negri bodies in rabies passion and
2:23:36
variola guordinary in vaccinia CC kojibana that is how we learned it ball
2:23:41
footballing our bodies and foul pox HP bodies type BB looks like a pita that is in
2:23:47
polio cow dry type A is going to look like hey that is herpes and yellow yellow methories bodies that is what you
2:23:54
had to know so on that note guys finally with a big big sigh of relief I am almost towards the end of it but
2:24:02
one more thing that I want to teach you is the last mnemonic of the viruses that are non-enveloped the viruses that are
2:24:09
non-enveloped so simple sabatha there will be a virus that virus is either going to be enveloped or that virus is
2:24:15
going to be known enveloped enveloped hoga or non-enveloped hoga when I'm talking about the enveloped viruses
2:24:21
everything comes under it but non-enveloped viruses
2:24:30
what all have I taken up I've taken up the a that is adenovirus the Parvovirus
2:24:36
b19 and the papova viride family so remember parvo Adeno papova these are
2:24:41
the Pap Pap is going to be the one which is non-enveloped and what is it in RNA viruses perch that is piconda Astro Rio
2:24:50
calci hepatitis can you find any commonality in between
2:24:55
them picorna Astro Rio calci hepatitis A and B H even if you can't find anything
2:25:01
common hepatitis A and E they are different from all the other hepatitis viruses why because they are free Coral
2:25:07
they are the ones which cause gastroenteritis actually you will realize that all of these are very
2:25:12
famous for causing gastroenteritis they are very very famous for causing gastroenteritis whether it is calci
2:25:19
virus or Rio virus Astro also I told you picorna can
2:25:24
also cause you also can go into the alimentary tract Hepatitis A and E also cause
2:25:31
gastroenteritis so what is the logic behind it see remember envelope looks that okay virus has an envelope it has
2:25:37
made it very strong but envelope will be the first thing to dissolve envelope is made up of lipid I put hand sanitizer on
2:25:43
it it will dissolve I put um Spirit on it hand sanitizer is alcohol or I put any kind of bile salts on it dissolved
2:25:50
lipid is going to dissolve very easily it is going to dissolve if you put any hand sanitizer if you put anything like
2:25:56
a bile salt anything toxic you will put lipid dissolving envelope is going to dissolve so when it goes into our
2:26:02
intestine when this virus goes into our intestine so dissolve because my bile salts are gonna easily dissolve it out
2:26:08
but these non-enveloped viruses they will not be dissolved by my bile salts
2:26:14
and that is why they are having a risk of causing gastroenteritis so remember
2:26:20
the pap and parchment there is
2:26:27
hepatitis A and E these are the viruses which are non-enveloped okay so one homework that
2:26:34
I gave to you which you have to do one more homework that I'm giving to you which is going to be from Gynecology because I've taught you everything but
2:26:40
the only thing that you have to study human papilloma virus but you already know if you want me to
2:26:47
give you a very very quick recap low risk human papilloma virus and
2:26:53
high-risk human papilloma virus when we are talking about low risk human papilloma virus I will think of Chota
2:26:59
Chota numbers like 6 and 11 which are famous for causing warts and when I think of high risk human papilloma virus
2:27:06
I will think of big big numbers like 18 and 16 which will cause the cancers be it any kind of human papilloma virus
2:27:12
what is this cell that you're gonna visualize this is the famous coilocyte what are the features of a coilocyte
2:27:17
they are going to have a very dark nuclear the dark nucleus is a razonoid nucleus and surrounding the razonoid
2:27:24
nucleus we are gonna have a very very light area that light area is going to be known as the Peri nuclear Halo that
2:27:32
light air area is referred to as a perineuclear Halo that is a coilocyte so who has made a coilocyte jaldi say make
2:27:39
a diagram of human papilloma virus remember God has given a given it L1 it
2:27:44
has God has given it E4 and E5 God has given it E6 and E7
2:27:50
so this coilover side that you're talking about is caused by E4 and E5 the colocyte that
2:27:57
you're talking about is caused by E4 and E5 what is L1 used for real L1 is a previous year two time repeat question
2:28:03
L1 capsid is used for the vaccine preparation of human papilloma virus and
2:28:08
last question what does E6 and E7 do the cancer formation is because of E6 and E7
2:28:13
how do they cause cancers that is the last question that we have E6 is going to switch off p53 Gene and E7 is going
2:28:20
to switch off the RB Gene so all of these genes are switched off and that is the reason obviously a Barbie Jean and
2:28:26
policeman gp53 here main main things you will switch off obviously patient is going to have cancer so finally we come
2:28:32
down to this we have L1 which makes the which we use for the vaccine E4 E5 make a reason or nucleus and a coilocyte
2:28:39
feature E6 and E7 are responsible for cancers low riskota numbers high risk
2:28:44
numbers high risk are the ones which cause cancer cervical cancer pathogenesis you all know this is very
2:28:50
very important and I hope you are now sorted with this so now I finally have not given you any homework I've only
2:28:56
given you one homework and that is knowing telling me the granuloma for plasmodium calcium which you anyway know
2:29:02
what other than that I know by now you have that list what apart from this do I have to study you guys have to study
2:29:08
mycology which we've already covered in your previous crash course so mycology photo photos
2:29:15
anyway post on telegram group right like like I had promised and doosra you have
2:29:20
to know that um I will be taking another session of the top 50 bullet points and
2:29:25
in those top 50 bullet points I won't be covering any of this again because top 50 bullet points I will be talking about
2:29:32
50 very important one-liners of General microbiology and also your
2:29:38
Immunology right so that date will definitely be updated to you soon for the next you know for the next almost
2:29:45
one week first you sit and finish this crash course then maybe on March 1st or
2:29:50
2nd we will come across with another very quick half an hour session where I'll be telling you about some bullet points okay guys on that note I hope you
2:29:58
guys found this session beneficial and yes despite all the obstacles that we faced yesterday we finally managed to
2:30:06
get this session on track yeah so thank you so much all the very best study well
2:30:11
and have confidence that whatever you're studying is definitely the best that you can do at this point of time especially
2:30:17
with volatile topics like this you need to have that little linear self-confidence that yeah I'm doing good
2:30:22
and I hope that this session has acted as a confidence booster thank you so much for all the patience and for
2:30:29
listening so carefully and yes feedback is always welcome so thank you guys good luck and God bless you all
